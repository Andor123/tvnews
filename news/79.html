    <h1 class="h1">Television in Myanmar</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television broadcasting in Myanmar began in 1979 as a test trial in Yangon. 
        The first television service BBS was launched on 3 June 1980, followed by regular service in 1981. 
        Most television networks in the country are broadcast from Yangon. MRTV and MWD are the two Burmese 
        state-owned television networks, providing Burmese-language programming in news and entertainment. 
        Other channels include MRTV Entertainment, M Entertainment Channel, MRTV-4, Channel 7, 5Plus, MNTV, Channel 9, 
        Mizzima TV, DVB TV, Channel K, YTV, Fortune TV, Mahar HD, HTV Sports Channel, Htv Channel, WAF Channel, 
        Channel Light Channel, Golden Land Channel, TVM Channel, and more than 20 TV channels. 
        Pay TV services include SKYNET, Myansat and CANAL+ Myanmar.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Technical details</h2>
    <p class="lead">When Myanmar (Burma) establishing their first television service, the choice of the 
        Broadcast System is a little bit odds, considering their Mains electricity and Geographic. 
        Myanmar (Burma) mains electricity is 230 volt at 50 Hz, and NTSC refresh rate is 60 Hz, 
        not synchronized with each others. Another odds situation is most of the neighboring countries 
        are adopting PAL-B/G system. But, Myanmar (Burma) has chose NTSC-M system as their analogue television standard. 
        The reason Myanmar (Burma) adopted NTSC-M standard is because of the JICA and Matsushita Electric. 
        They are involved during the establishment of Myanmar's first television service and, they are supporting 
        trough various methods like Financially, Technologically and Broadcast Expertise. They lobbying to Ministry of Information Burma 
        and Burma Broadcasting Service to adopt NTSC, and the MOI and BBS is agreed. In early 2010s when the Government of Myanmar 
        is working to adopt Digital terrestrial television standard, Myanmar's chose DVB-T2 standard. In turn of technologically, 
        DVB-T2 is the most advanced standard and most optimized for Multi-channels purposes, Exactly all Myanmar's broadcasters wanted.</p>
