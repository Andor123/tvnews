    <h1 class="h1">Television in Venezuela</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Venezuela began in 1952, when the then President of Venezuela, Marcos Pérez Jiménez launched the state channel Televisora Nacional, 
        making Venezuela the ninth country in the world to have a public television network. By 1963, a quarter of Venezuelan households had television; 
        a figure rising to 45% by 1969 and 85% by 1982. Telenovelas are popular in Venezuela, and some Venezuelan productions (such as Cara Sucia) are distributed internationally. 
        Perhaps the best known television show internationally was President Hugo Chávez' weekly talk show Aló Presidente, which began in 1999 and ended in 2012. 
        The government also makes regular use of cadena nacionales (mandatory interruptions on all channels to show government broadcasts).</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Channels and channel owners</h2>
    <p class="lead">Televisa was the second television network to begin operations in Venezuela after Televisora Nacional, 
        and the first commercial network before Radio Caracas Televisión both in 1953. Ondas del Lago Televisión was 
        the first Venezuelan regional television network based in Maracaibo, Zulia State. 
        Created in 1957, lasted only a few months before ceasing operations. Actually the main private television networks are Venevisión, Televen and Globovisión. 
        Public-owned television includes Venezolana de Televisión, TVes, ViVe and teleSUR. 
        There are also local community-run television stations such as Catia TVe and a range of regional networks such as Zuliana de Televisión. 
        The Venezuelan government also provides funding to Avila TV, Buena TV and Asamblea Nacional Televisión.</p>
    <p class="lead">"Communitarian channels," funded by the Venezuelan government, are not counted as state television in 
        figures despite relying on government funding to broadcast. "Communitarian channels technically are supposed to be independent, 
        and many of them struggle to assert some autonomy vis-à-vis the state, but only progovernment channels receive state funding and support. 
        Given that there are few other funding sources, communitarian channels inevitably end up complying with state directives."</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Programming</h2>
    <p class="lead">Telenovelas are popular in Venezuela, and some Venezuelan productions (such as Cara Sucia) are distributed internationally. 
        Perhaps the best known television show internationally was however, President Hugo Chávez' weekly talk show Aló Presidente, 
        which began in 1999 and ran with occasional breaks until 2012.</p>
    <p class="lead">The Chávez government devoted considerable financial resources to support community television as part of its view of participatory democracy. 
        Community television programs received funds through the National Ministry of Communication and PDVSA corporate social responsibility funds. 
        Community programs like Catia TVe provided a forum for marginalized communities in Venezuela.</p>
