    <p class="lead">Television was introduced in Czechoslovakia in 1953. Experimental projects with
        DVB-T started in 2000. Finally on 21 October 2005, multiplex A (DVB-T) was launched with
        the channels of Česká televize and one of TV Nova and radio channels of Český rozhlas.</p>
    <p class="lead">On April 12, 2006, six digital terrestrial television licenses
        were awarded to commercial broadcasters. The receivers of the licenses were:
        Z1, TV Pohoda, Regionální televizni agentura (RTA), Febio TV,
        TV Barrandov and Óčko. However, because of delays some projects
        lost investors and will not start (e.g. Fabio, Pohoda) or were cancelled.
        Z1 provided a news service in from 2008 to January 2011,
        when it ceased broadcasting. Óčko delivers a music service.
        TV Barrandov provides general programming services.</p>
    <p class="lead">Czech Republic become the first country in central
        and eastern Europe to start to end all analogue broadcasts in November 2011.
        The process completed when the last analogue transmitters in south-east Moravia
        and northern Moravia-Silesia were shut down on June 30, 2012.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Milestone of digitalization</h2>
    <p class="lead">In September 2008, when multiplex A was available in Prague,
        Central Bohemian Region, in surrounding areas of Brno, Ostrava, Domažlice
        and Ústí nad Labem, leave this multiplex with their 4 channels Česká televize.
        All channels of Česká televize (ČT1, ČT2, ČT24 and ČT4) is now in multiplex 1
        (with can be seen in Bohemia (except few exceptions), in surrounding areas
        of Brno and in Ostrava). Multiplex A transform to multiplex 2 with stations
        TV Prima, Prima Cool / TV R1, TV Barrandov, TV Nova and Nova Cinema. The cover is
        very similar as multiplex 1, except southeast part of Bohemie. Multiplex B
        transform to multiplex 3. Now there are broadcasting "Public TV" (its commercial station),
        Z1 and until 31 July 2009 Óčko. In Prague there is broadcasting
        multiplex 3 on two frequency. On one of this frequency you can see also
        Noe TV and Prima HDTV. Multiplex 3 covered just Prague, Brno, Ostrava, Plzeň
        and Ústí nad Labem. This multiplex now had problem to find reliable stations to
        broadcast. There is also multiplex 4 which is operated by O2, but there is broadcast
        only ČT1 HD and Nova HDTV and covered is just center of Prague, center of Plzeň,
        center of Ostrava and center of Brno.</p>
