    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">One state-run TV station, Radio Télévision Guinéenne (RTG); 
        foreign TV programming is available via satellite and cable subscription services (2011).</p>
    <p class="lead">6 TV stations (1997).</p>
    <h2 class="h2">State censorship</h2>
    <p class="lead">The government maintains marginal control over broadcast media, 
        the media laws promulgated following the 2010 democratic transition have not been implemented, 
        and there are reports of state censorship through journalist harassment and station closures. For example:</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">On 26 August 2012, the National Communication Council (CNC) suspended private radio station Liberte FM, 
            based in the Forest Region city of N’Zerekore. The closure prevented Liberte FM from covering protests announced 
            by opposition leaders for the following day. The national government allowed Liberty FM to reopen 48 hours later, after the protests concluded.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">On 1 October 2012, Electricity of Guinea cut service to Espace FM, host of the investigative reporting radio program "The Big Mouths." 
            The utility company claimed that Espace FM and its sister station, Sweet FM, collectively owed nearly 150 million GNF ($21,521) for electricity bills, 
            despite the station's possession of payment receipts. Both stations were forced to operate on expensive generator power.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">The government has been accused of penalizing stations and journalists who 
            broadcast items criticizing government officials and their actions. Some journalists accuse government officials of attempting to 
            influence the tone of their reporting with inappropriate pressure and bribes. Some journalists also hire bodyguards, and many practice self-censorship.</li>
