    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Australia began experimentally as early as 1929 in Melbourne with 
        radio stations 3DB and 3UZ, and 2UE in Sydney, using the Radiovision system by Gilbert Miles and Donald McDonald, 
        and later from other locations, such as Brisbane in 1934.</p>
    <p class="lead">Mainstream television was launched on 16 September 1956 in Willoughby, 
        New South Wales, with Nine Network station TCN-9 Sydney. The new medium was introduced by 
        advertising executive Bruce Gyngell with the words "Good evening, and welcome to television", 
        and has since seen the transition to colour and digital television.</p>
    <p class="lead">Local programs, over the years, have included a broad range of comedy, sport, 
        and in particular drama series, in addition to news and current affairs. The industry is regulated by 
        the Australian Communications and Media Authority, through various legislation, regulations, 
        standards and codes of practice, which also regulates radio and in recent years has attempted to regulate the Internet.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">In 1885, Henry Sutton developed a Telephane for closed circuit transmission of pictures via telegraph wires, 
        based on the Nipkow spinning disk system, so that the Melbourne Cup could be seen in Ballarat. 
        Reports differ on whether the Telephane was successfully implemented.</p>
    <p class="lead">The first television broadcast in Australia took place on 30 September 1929 
        at the Menzies Hotel in Melbourne, using the electro-mechanical Radiovision system. 
        Other transmissions took place in the city over the next few weeks. Also in 1929, 
        the Baird system was used on 3DB, 3UZ and 2UE.</p>
    <p class="lead">After 18 months of test transmissions, regular broadcasts began in Brisbane on 6 May 1934 using a 30-line system, 
        to an estimated 18 receivers around Brisbane. The test transmissions, which were of 1-hour duration each day, 
        were made by Thomas M. B. Elliott and Dr Val McDowall from the Wickham Terrace Observatory Tower. 
        The programs included news headlines, still pictures and silent movies such as the temperance film Horrors of Drink. 
        The Commonwealth Government granted a special licence and permission to conduct experimental television by VK4CM, 
        in July 1934. By 1935, it expanded to 180 lines. Other experimental transmissions followed in other cities.</p>
