    <h1 class="h1">Television in Pakistan</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Pakistan started in 1964 and the first live transmission of 
        Pakistan Television began on 26 November 1964, in Lahore.</p>
    <p class="lead">In the early 2020s there were some 114 satellite TV channels in Pakistan, with most (42) 
        concentrating on entertainment followed by news and current affairs (31).</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">In 1955, Pakistan's first television showcase occurred near Mazar-e-Quaid on September 16, 
        organized by the American consulate in Karachi. The initiative to establish the television industry stemmed 
        from the National Education Commission, backed by President Ayub Khan. 
        Originally a private project led by Syed Wajjid Ali in 1961, a joint venture agreement 
        with Nippon Electric Company (NEC) was signed. Engineer Ubaidur Rahman, appointed by Wajjid Ali, 
        oversaw the project. By 1963, the government took control for the "greater national interest."</p>
    <p class="lead">In 1964, the first official television station began broadcasts in Lahore, 
        followed by Dhaka in 1965. Rawalpindi-Islamabad and Karachi centers were established 
        in 1965 and 1966, respectively. Peshawar and Quetta centers followed by 1974. 
        Initially under Television Promoters Company (TPC) in 1966, it was upgraded to 
        Pakistan Television Corp in 1967. Nationalised in 1972, PTV's experimental color transmission started in 1976. 
        In 1987, the Pakistan Television Academy was founded for training in the evolving medium. 
        In the late 1980s, morning transmissions commenced.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">Liberalisation of the Media Industry in 2002</h3>
    <p class="lead">A pivotal moment in the history of television in Pakistan occurred in the year 2002 
        with the liberalisation of the media industry. This transformative development marked a departure from the 
        previously tightly controlled landscape, ushering in a new era of diversity, competition, 
        and expanded opportunities for broadcasters. The government's decision to open up the media sector allowed 
        private television channels to operate openly, telecasting their own news, current affairs, and entertainment content.</p>
    <p class="lead">This liberalisation led to the emergence of a dynamic and competitive television market, 
        with several private channels making their debut. Channels like ARY Digital, Geo Entertainment, 
        and Hum TV were launched, introducing a diverse range of programming to the Pakistani audience. 
        The newfound freedom and autonomy provided to private broadcasters paved the way for innovative and varied content, 
        reflecting the rich culture of the nation. The liberalisation not only transformed the television landscape 
        but also played a crucial role in shaping public discourse and access to information.</p>
