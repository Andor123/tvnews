    <h1 class="h1">Television in Canada</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Canada officially began with the sign-on of the nation's first television stations in Montreal and Toronto in 1952. 
        As with most media in Canada, the television industry, and the television programming available in that country, 
        are strongly influenced by media in the United States and the United Kingdom, perhaps to an extent not seen in any other major industrialized nation. 
        As a result, the government institutes quotas for "Canadian content". Nonetheless, new content is often aimed at a broader North American audience, 
        although the similarities may be less pronounced in the predominantly French-language province of Quebec.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <h3 class="h3">Development of television</h3>
    <p class="lead">The first experimental television broadcast began in 1932 in Montreal, Quebec, under the call sign of VE9EC. 
        The broadcasts of VE9EC were broadcast in 60 to 150 lines of resolution on 41 MHz. This service closed around 1935, 
        and the outbreak of World War II put a halt to television experiments. Television in Canada on major networks pre-date any telecasts 
        that originated in the country as thousands of television sets that were capable of receiving U.S.-based signals 
        were installed in homes near the Canada–US border between 1946 and 1953. Homes in southern and southwestern Ontario and portions of British Columbia, 
        including the Toronto, Hamilton, London, Windsor, Victoria and Vancouver areas, were able to receive television stations from 
        Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit or Seattle with the help of elevated outdoor antennas and amplifiers. 
        U.S. television programs and the networks that originated them thus became popular in those Canadian cities within range of their signals, 
        and those cities represented a sizeable proportion of the total Canadian population. 
        This helped spur development of a specifically Canadian television programming and transmission system during the late 1940s and early 1950s, 
        but at the same time caused it to develop within American technical standards that had been previously mandated by 
        the Federal Communications Commission between 1941 and 1946.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">Broadcast television</h3>
    <p class="lead">While American television stations, including affiliates of ABC, NBC and CBS, near the Canada–US border were available for several years prior, 
        and gained a sizeable audience in cities like Toronto, within range of U.S. signals, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) was the first entity 
        to broadcast television programming within Canada, launching in September 1952 in both Montreal and Toronto. 
        Private CBC affiliates began operating late in 1953 to supplement the Corporation's own stations; the first private CBC affiliate in Canada was CKSO-TV in Sudbury, 
        Ontario in October of that year, with CFPL-TV in London, Ontario following a few weeks later. 
        All television stations that signed on in Canada were required to be CBC affiliates, as the CBC was the only television network operating in Canada at the time.</p>
