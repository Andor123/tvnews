    <h1 class="h1">Television in Bangladesh</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television is one of the most popular forms of media and information in Bangladesh. 
        It was one of the first countries in South Asia to introduce television on 25 December 1964, 
        in the then East Pakistan under the state-owned television network Pakistan Television Corporation 
        in its capital, Dhaka. After the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, the Dhaka television station of 
        PTV was renamed to Bangladesh Television, which had a monopoly on the country's television industry until 1997, 
        with the launch of ATN Bangla on satellite television. Since then, the number of privately owned 
        television channels saw a tremendous rise in the Bangladeshi television market.</p>
    <p class="lead">As of 2019, 64% of households in Bangladesh had a television set, 
        with cable television dominating the pay television market there. 
        This is a tremendous increase compared to the data from 1975, 
        when less than 0.2% of Bangladeshi households had a television set.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <h3 class="h3">Early ages</h3>
    <p class="lead">Television programming in the then East Pakistan was first commenced in 1964, 
        when Pakistan Television established a television station in Dacca, the first after Lahore, 
        and broadcast from the DIT Bhaban on a four-hour basis. On 4 March 1971, PTV's Dacca television station 
        was unofficially renamed "Dhaka Television", and on 23 March, it began showing the flag of Bangladesh 
        and playing the national anthem of Bangladesh and several pro-Bangladesh songs, as a part of the station 
        to join the struggle for independence from Pakistan.[8] After the independence of Bangladesh, 
        the station was immediately renamed Bangladesh Television, subsequently becoming a government-owned entity. 
        In 1975, Bangladesh Television moved its studios and facilities in a newly built headquarters in Rampura.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">Rise of satellite television</h3>
    <p class="lead">Satellite television was introduced in Bangladesh in 1992, with over ten 
        foreign channels having a presence in the country at the time. Simultaneously, 
        the first cable company (Translinks), affiliated to Star TV, opened in the same year. 
        The first Bengali-language satellite television channel based in Bangladesh, ATN Bangla, 
        was launched in 1997, followed by Channel i in 1999. Satellite television saw a tremendous increase 
        in popularity among Bangladeshis at that period, and thus, Bangladesh Television began to stagnate.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">After the fall of the Hasina government</h3>
    <p class="lead">During the quota reform protests, the headquarters of Bangladesh Television was subject to 
        an arson attack and was vandalized on 18 July 2024, forcing the network to cease transmissions temporarily, 
        although it resumed transmissions the following day. Shortly after the resignation of prime minister Sheikh Hasina on 5 August 2024, 
        several television channels, primarily ones that are news-oriented, were attacked and vandalized, 
        including Ekattor TV, DBC News, Somoy TV, Independent Television etc. Later on, eight television channels were forced off 
        the air as a result of the attacks, although they have resumed transmissions over time.</p>
