    <h1 class="h1">Television in Brazil</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Brazil has grown significantly since the first broadcasts in 18 September 1950, 
        with the (now defunct) Rede Tupi by Assis Chateaubriand, becoming one of the largest and most productive commercial television systems in the world. 
        Its biggest network, TV Globo (founded by Roberto Marinho in 26 April 1965), is the largest commercial network in South America, 
        and is one of the major television exporter globally, particularly of telenovelas, having become popular in many countries. 
        There are more than 90 free-to-air television networks (national and regional), as well as satellite channels broadcasting throughout the country.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">In Brazil around the same time, the concessions for the first television broadcast network were decreed and distributed by 
        President Eurico Gaspar Dutra's administration, and a cornerstone was placed for the very first transmitter in Brazil for the first commercial network, Rede Tupi. 
        It was initially located in the municipality of Morro do Pão de Açúcar, in the city of Rio de Janeiro. By 1949, a group of technicians and engineers arrived 
        in Brazil and visited the planned location for the broadcast tower for the first time only to find that due to the topography in Rio, 
        the planned broadcast tower site wouldn't be the ideal place for its installation. As media mogul Assis Chateaubriand was interested in the 
        opening of the first broadcast television network in Brazil and Latin America and already knew that the US was crucial in sponsoring the 
        first TV broadcast in Cuba on Christmas Day of 1950, he decided to transfer to São Paulo for the inaugural broadcast, and the government gave the concession of channel 3, 
        given by Radio Difusora in order to start Rede Tupi's operations.</p>
    <p class="lead">Then, Chateaubriand ordered the broadcasting equipment necessary, for the station had already been built, just in time for this installation. 
        In July 1950, the equipment arrived by ship in Port Santos and was accompanied to the capital by one of the many artists of the Emissoras Associadas group 
        in São Paulo via motorcade. The motorcade was a hit, and crowds gathered to see the equipment being driven to the new station, 
        a preview of what the new station would offer.</p>
    <p class="lead">Television became a mass medium in Brazil earlier than in most developing countries. 
        The military dictatorship which took power in 1964 saw audiovisual communication as a tool for creating a stronger national identity, 
        a broader consumer economy, and controlling political information. The military pushed television deeper into the population by subsidizing credit for set sales, 
        building national microwave and satellite distribution systems, which prompted the growth of Rede Globo, which they chose as a privileged partner.</p>
    <p class="lead">Globo, launched a few months after the 1964 coup, created the first true national network by the late 1960s. 
        Censorship of news was extensive under the military governments between 1966 and 1978, but it also encouraged national television program production. 
        In the early 1970s, several government ministers pushed the commercial networks to develop more Brazilian programming and reduce reliance on imported programs, 
        particularly those with violent and sexual content. While Globo adopted an international model for operations, 90 percent of its content was produced in Brazil.</p>
