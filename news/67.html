    <h1 class="h1">Television in India</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">The television industry in India is very diverse and produces thousands of 
        programmes in many Indian languages. Nearly 87% of Indian households own a television. 
        As of 2016, the country had over 900 channels of which 184 were pay channels. 
        National channels operate in Hindi and English, in addition to channels in several other languages 
        including Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Tulu, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi, Odia, Punjabi, Rajasthani, Assamese, 
        Manipuri, Gujarati, Urdu, Bhojpuri, Kashmiri, Konkani, Haryanvi and Himachali, among others. 
        The Hindi, Telugu and Tamil language television industries are by far the largest television industries in India.</p>
    <p class="lead">The national television broadcaster is Doordarshan, owned by Prasar Bharati. 
        There are several commercial television broadcasters such as Culver Max Entertainment (Sony Pictures Networks), 
        Disney Star, Viacom18 (owned by Reliance Industries through Network18 Group), Warner Bros. Discovery India 
        and Zee Entertainment Enterprises, at the national level, and Sun TV Network and ETV Network at the regional level.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">In January 1950, The Indian Express reported that a television was put up for demonstration at an exhibition in 
        the Teynampet locality of Chennai (formerly Madras) by B. Sivakumaran, a student of electrical engineering. 
        A letter was scanned and its image was displayed on a cathode-ray tube screen. The report said that 
        "It may be this is not the whole of television but it is certainly the most significant link in the system" 
        and added that the demonstration of the sort could be the "first in India".</p>
    <p class="lead">The first TV transmitter in India was installed in the Electronics and 
        Telecommunications Engineering Department of the Jabalpur Engineering College on 24 October 1951.</p>
    <p class="lead">In Srinagar, television was first used in the house of the Jan family, 
        which was a huge milestone for industrialisation.</p>
    <p class="lead">In 1952, the government's Scientific Advisory Committee for Broadcasting recommended 
        the creation of a pilot station to showcase television's potential to viewers. 
        A television demonstration was held in Bombay from 10 to 12 October 1954. 
        In 1955, an officer of All India Radio went to the United States to study telecommunications. 
        Television remains a widely consumed medium across India, with its reach spanning millions of 
        viewers across urban and rural regions. An experiment was conducted at the American Pavilion of 
        the 1955 Indian Industries Fair, which opened on 29 October 1955, with PM Nehru being the first face
         to appear on television in India. Existing radio networks were open to start a television network.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Broadcast media</h2>
    <p class="lead">There are at least five basic types of television in India: broadcast or "over-the-air" television, 
        unencrypted satellite or "free-to-air", Direct-to-Home (DTH), cable television, IPTV and OTT. 
        Over-the-air terrestrial and free-to-air TV (such as DD Free Dish) is free with no monthly payments while cable, 
        DTH, and IPTV require a subscription that varies depending on how many channels a subscriber chooses to 
        pay for and how much the provider is charging for the packages. Channels are usually sold in groups or a la carte. 
        All television service providers are required by law to provide the a la carte selection of channels. 
        India is the second largest pay-TV market in the world in terms of subscribers after China 
        and has more than doubled from 32% in 2001 to 66% in 2018.</p>
