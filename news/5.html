    <h1 class="h1">Television in Bosnia and Herzegovina</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Bosnia and Herzegovina was first introduced in 1956.
        First broadcasting in Bosnia and Herzegovina started in 1961 when Televizija Sarajevo began
        its programme although without its own TV studio at that time (it used Radio Sarajevo's premises for this purpose).</p>
    <p class="lead">Today there are 150 licensed TV broadcasters in Bosnia and Herzegovina (23 Public and 127 Private).
        The process of digitization is still going on in Bosnia and it is expected to
        leave the analog frequency bands. There are plans to establish a public TV corporation
        that would operate, consolidate and improve quality of all Bosnian public broadcasters.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Analog television</h2>
    <p class="lead">Bosnia and Herzegovina has 3 public broadcasters financed from radio and television fees
        (RTV pretplata/pristojba). The amount of television fees in BiH is 7.5 BAM per month
        (collected along with the bill for landline telephony service).</p>
    <p class="lead">The national public broadcaster for Bosnia and Herzegovina is BHRT
        (Radio televizija Bosne i Hercegovine). With one television and one
        radio channel it covers more than 97% of the country.
        BHRT is the only Bosnian member of the European Broadcasting Union.</p>
    <p class="lead">The entity broadcaster for Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is
        RTVFBiH (Radio televizija Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine).
        The program is broadcast on one radio and one television channel.
        The entity broadcaster for Republika Srpska is RTRS (Radio televizija Republike Srpske).
        The program is broadcast via one radio and two television channels (one channel is via cable systems).</p>
    <p class="lead">There are 23 other public TV stations which broadcast only locally at the municipal,
        local, and regional levels, such as 5 cantonal TV stations (TVSA, RTV TK, RTV USK, RTV ZE, and RTV BPK).</p>
    <p class="lead">Private TV stations with a nationwide coverage are OBN and Pink BH.</p>
    <p class="lead">Out of 30 private TV stations, the majority are only locally available,
        either on a municipal level (e.g. TV KISS from Kiseljak or TV Maglaj from Maglaj)
        or on a near national level (e.g. Hayat in the FBiH entity or Alternativna TV in
        the Republika Srpska entity). These broadcasters are primarily focused on the entitiy markets,
        but they also broadcast a joint program known as "Program Plus" on 85% of the
        territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
    <p class="lead">Several local and regional private TV stations broadcast a joint program known as "Mre≈æa TV".
        These broadcasters provide a common advertising space (on country, entity, or regional level)
        that is more attractive to major advertisers. Local TV networks share local news
        (e.g. PRIMA network in the RS entity).</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Digital television</h2>
    <p class="lead">The process of digitization is still going on in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
        One analog transmitter was shut down in June 2015 by request of neighboring Serbia,
        affecting one of the public broadcast channels, but the signal was reestablished within days.</p>
    <p class="lead">Communications Regulatory Agency of BiH issued the first licenses for
        digital broadcasting in BiH to broadcasters BHRT, RTVFBIH and RTRS.
        Permits are valid from March 1, 2016 year.
        A DVB-T test signal on MUX-A was expected by the end of 2016
        in some parts of the country, and the tender procedure for completing
        MUX-A for the whole territory of the country ("second phase") has started.
        As of August 2016, there are no news about MUX-B, which is intended
        for privately owned and regional TV stations.</p>
