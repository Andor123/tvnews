    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television was introduced to Mozambique in 1981. For more than a decade, Televisão de Moçambique was the country's only television channel. 
        Its monopoly was broken by the now-defunct RTK in 1993 and was followed by several other television stations. 
        Maputo houses the facilities of practically all television channels in Mozambique. Foreign channels RTP África and Televisão Miramar have high viewership rates.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">When Mozambique was under Portuguese control, Rádio Clube de Moçambique (the current Rádio Moçambique) had plans to start a television service. 
        These were likely halted as an effect of the country's independence in 1975.</p>
    <p class="lead">In August 1979, an Italian company set up a small improvised studio at the Maputo Internacional Fair (FACIM).</p>
    <p class="lead">Experimental Television of Mozambique (Televisão Experimental de Moçambique) started its broadcasts on 3 February 1981 on Sundays from 6:30pm to 10pm, 
        on UHF channel 33 in Maputo. Gradually its broadcasting increased to the entire week (in 1986 it was broadcasting six hours a day and four days a week), 
        achieving that goal in 1991. Color television was introduced in 1984.</p>
    <p class="lead">TVM started broadcasting to Beira in April 1992 with funding from RTP, who provided technical support 
        in the development of the network due to a protocol signed in September 1989., followed by Nampula in September 1994, 
        as well as the ability of relaying RTP Internacional, whose terrestrial frequency was replaced by RTP África in 1998.</p>
