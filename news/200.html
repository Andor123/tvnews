    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Trinidad and Tobago was introduced in 1962 beginning with Trinidad & Tobago Television. 
        TTT was the sole television station for 29 years being operated by the state until the first independently operated television station, 
        the Caribbean Communications Network, CCN TV6 was launched in 1991 breaking the television monopoly market. 
        In 1992, a second independently operated station, AVM Television was launched. The first independently operated cable station, 
        The Trinity Network (TTN) now Trinity TV began operations in 1993 broadcasting on weekends only.</p>
    <p class="lead">AVM Television was acquired by the state in 1997 and renamed The Information Channel (TIC) until it was leased by 
        the National Carnival Commission in 2005 and re-branded NCC4. Once the lease ended in 2011, the state began controlling 
        the station once more under the Government Information Services Limited (GISL TV4) until 2017. The station was closed for 
        three years and re-launched as the Education Channel in 2020.</p>
    <p class="lead">TTT was shut down by the state on 14 January 2005 due to financial difficulties. In its place a new state entity was created, 
        the Caribbean News Media Group (CNMG), where C Television (CTV) began broadcasting in 2006. Since the closure of TTT, 
        new independently operated stations were launched, the most notable being the Cable News Channel 3 or CNC3. 
        After several years of being off the air, it was found that TTT still had a strong brand identity among the population and a cult following on social media. 
        On 30 August 2018, TTT was re-launched replacing CTV.</p>
    <p class="lead">Broadcast networks in Trinidad and Tobago can be divided into three categories:</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">Commercial broadcasting networks (which air English-language programming to a general audience). Example: CNC3</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Educational and other non-commercial broadcasting member stations (which air English- and some foreign-language television programming, 
            intended to be educational television or otherwise of a sort not found on commercial television). Example: The Parliament Channel</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Religious broadcasting networks. Example: TV Jaagriti</li>
    </ul>
