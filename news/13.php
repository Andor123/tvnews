    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Albania was first introduced in 1960.
        RTSH dominated the Albanian broadcasting field up to the mid-1990s,
        a period when privately owned radio and TV stations started to occupy
        the vast empty Albanian frequencies. Transition to
        DTV broadcasting is stalling.</p>
    <p class="lead">Albania at the moment has 3 national commercial television stations,
        56 local stations, 83 local cable stations and two commercial multiplexes.</p>
    <p class="lead">Of all the existing national analogue television stations,
        the public broadcaster Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH) has
        the greatest reach: its signal covers 80.5% of the territory,
        followed by Top Channel with 79%, and TV Klan with 78%.
        However, there are also digital multiplexes but they are unaccounted
        for in the territorial reach figures. It could be said that the other
        main TV stations, based in Tirana, whose signal covers a significant
        part of the territory include: Ora News, News 24, Vizion Plus, A1 Report,
        and Radio Televizioni SCAN. Apart from Vizion Plus TV and
        Radio Televizioni SCAN, the other stations are all-news ones.</p>
