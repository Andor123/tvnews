    <p class="lead">Ahead of the launching of television service in Brunei, the broadcaster sent more than five of 
        its staff members to undergo training at Radio Television Singapore (RTS) in late January 1975.</p>
    <p class="lead">Radio Television Brunei launched its first pilot television broadcast on 1 February 1975 
        when RTB Television Brunei test transmissions began. Official regular television services began on 1 March 1975 from Brunei-Muara District. 
        RTB1 was officially opened by the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah on 9 July 1975, 
        with the Radio Brunei and Television Brunei identities merging to become Radio Television Brunei, abbreviated as RTB. 
        There were only three staff members in the RTB studio and four to attend the transmitter.</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">Phase 1 - Used part of the Radio Studios as the television station.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Phase 2 - Utilising the current multi-purpose studio complex which was fully commissioned by 1980. 
            A second television transmitter was commissioned at Brunei-Muara District on 1 March 1976.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lead">On 1 March 1976 was also the year of the first outside television broadcast which was the 
        coverage of His Majesty's birthday parade from the then 'Town Padang'. The television project was budgeted at B$35M. 
        FM Stereo Radio Services from Brunei-Muara District started on 1 March 1977. At the same time, two high power medium 
        wave stations in Brunei-Muara District commenced transmission of the Malay language service. Today, around 1,100 employees work in RTB. 
        Coverage by radio and television is almost 100% for Brunei.</p>
