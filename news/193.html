    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">ZIZ launched a television division on 3 December 1972; during that decade, it operated one transmitter and four translators across the territory. 
        Throughout the mid-1980s, the station aired 5½ hours of programming every weeknight, 
        and ran a separate telex-based information channel on the island country's newly established cable system. 
        In 2001, its lineup aired from 4:00 till 11:00 p.m., switching to Fox Family programming during off hours; in Nevis, the 7:00–11:00 
        portion carried material from that island's Information Service. As of 2006, ZIZ was Saint Kitts and Nevis' sole national television channel. 
        Foreign programming accounted for 90% of ZIZ Television's offerings in 1975; with regards to U.S. content, this figure became 60–65% in the 1980s. 
        Around the turn of the 21st century, the local political opposition saw the station as a government mouthpiece and accused it of denying them airtime.</p>
    <p class="lead">ZIZ's radio programming is broadcast across the FM frequencies 95.9, 96.1, 96.3, and 96.9. The AM feed began transmission on 570 kHz in the 1960s, 
        and was also heard during that period across the British Leeward Islands as well as the neighbouring French and Dutch territories. 
        It later moved to 555 kHz, and remained there as late as the 2010s. The television service, which airs on channel 5, served the entire Leeward archipelago in the 1970s 
        and was included in the mid-1984 launch of the national cable system. In 1989, it was received on channel 9 in northern St. Kitts Island and channel 13 in Nevis.</p>
