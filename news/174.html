    <h1 class="h1">Television in Bolivia</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Bolivia arrived in 1967 and is one of the media that integrates the national population. 
        Currently there are 185 stations or television stations in the national territory, most of which are installed in 
        the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra with 37 television media outlets. Currently there are 8 networks that cover the entire national area. 
        There are also themed and cable channels.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">In May 1961, the Bolivian government set up Televisión Boliviana (Televibol), a private company set to exploit television signals in the city of La Paz. 
        Televibol also had plans to launch stations in other parts of the country and had the possibility of selling and servicing equipment once television launched. 
        The absence of television in Bolivia until 1969 was derived mainly from the extant limitations of Bolivian radio, which had a lack of money and manpower. 
        Communication problems between speakers of Spanish and speakers of native languages caused a language barrier. Few people in Bolivia had radio as of 1964. 
        There were hopes for the radio infrastructure to be improved in order to assess the feasibility of a television station.</p>
    <p class="lead">Following the 1966 Bolivian general election, plans were already underway for a national television service owned by the government. 
        Up until then, Bolivia was served by a small number of closed-circuit experimental systems. 
        Provisions were made for the government to provide a one-year monopoly to the first TV station in Bolivia, scheduled to start before the end of 1966. 
        The state had already reserved three frequencies, channel 5 in La Paz, channel 4 in Cochabamba and channel 3 in Santa Cruz de la Sierra. 
        After the prospective first year period ended, the state would allow the creation of private television stations.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Television networks</h2>
    <p class="lead">With the exception of Unitel, which usually broadcasts from its headquarters in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, 
        most of the channels have their operations concentrated in the Government Headquarters (in the department of La Paz). 
        The channels Unitel, ATB, Red Uno, Bolivisión and (to a lesser extent) Bolivia TV; usually broadcast local newscasts, 
        at least in the cities that make up the main axis (La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz). 
        The only public network is Bolivia TV, the rest being controlled by private businessmen.</p>
    <p class="lead">Their transmitting plants are commonly located in Ciudad Satélite, located in El Alto. 
        This practice began when Telesistema Boliviano (today, Unitel) established its transmitting antenna in that place. 
        The channels also own their own affiliates, with several exceptions; Red Uno does not operate in Tarija, Chuquisaca and Potosí, 
        but licenses its operations to the company Comunicación Integral S.R.L., while Unitel operates through affiliates in the regions, 
        in order to focus on the main axis, Oruro, Beni and Pando.</p>
