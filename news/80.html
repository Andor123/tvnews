    <h1 class="h1">Television in Taiwan</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Taiwan is primarily in Chinese and English. 
        It is delivered through analog and digital, cable, IPTV, and the Internet.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Digital television</h2>
    <p class="lead">Digital television launched terrestrially throughout Taiwan on 1 July 2004, 
        using the European DVB-T system. After years of simulcasting, Taiwan replaced American analogue 
        broadcasting system NTSC with a digital system by 2014. The Republic of China Cabinet approved a 
        measure mandating that all new televisions are to be equipped with a digital television tuner from 2006. 
        The rule applied to TVs measuring between 21 and 29 inches in 2007, and to sets of all sizes in 2008. 
        To assist lower-income families with the switch to digital television, the government provided 
        NT$300 million in aid to purchase converters or for the purchase of new digital televisions. 
        In February 2009, the National Communications Commission proposed amendments to the Cable Television Act; 
        they include mandating cable companies to provide free set-top boxes.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Cable television</h2>
    <p class="lead">Cable television is prevalent in Taiwan, as a result of cheap subscription rates 
        (typically around NT$550, or US$15 a month) and the paucity of free-to-air television, 
        which comprises four channels. Programming is mostly in Mandarin and Taiwanese, with some English, Japanese 
        and other foreign-language channels. Miniseries, called Taiwanese drama, are popular and are being exported 
        to markets mainly in East and Southeast Asia, and Latin America, with some dramas available on OTT platforms 
        such as Netflix, YouTube, or Viki. There is a dedicated station for Taiwan's Hakka minority as well as the arrival 
        in 2005 of an aboriginal channel. Almost all programs are in the original language with traditional Chinese subtitles.</p>
