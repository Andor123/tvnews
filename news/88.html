    <h1 class="h1">Television in South Korea</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">In South Korea, there are a number of national television networks, 
        the three largest of which are KBS, MBC, and SBS. Most of the major television studios 
        are located on Yeouido and Sangam-dong, Seoul. South Korea became the fourth adopter 
        in Asia when television broadcasting began on 12 May 1956 with the opening of HLKZ-TV, 
        a commercially operated television station. HLKZ-TV was established by the RCA Distribution Company (KORCAD) 
        in Seoul with 186–192 MHz, 100-watt output, and 525 scanning lines.</p>
    <p class="lead">Important genres of television shows include serial dramas, historical dramas, 
        variety shows, game shows, news programs, and documentaries. All three networks have 
        produced increasingly lavish historical dramas in recent years. Some South Korean television programs 
        are available on satellite and multicultural channels in foreign countries. South Korean television dramas 
        have been widely popular in other East Asian, South Asian and Southeast Asian countries, 
        and became popularized internationally at a later stage, with whole sets of videotapes or 
        DVDs of series available with completed subtitles in different languages, online subtitle 
        websites are also created by numerous fan clubs to cater to a global audience. 
        Shopping channels have become quite popular in recent years as well, and the models 
        sometimes put on entertaining acts during product pitches.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">Since the beginning of the 1950s, television was introduced to Korea by RCA 
        to sell second-hand black & white TV sets as a marketing scheme. Some TV sets were strategically 
        set up at Pagoda Park, others at the Seoul Station and Gwanghwamun during this time. 
        However it was not until 1956 when South Korea began its own television broadcasting station, 
        the HLKZ-TV, part of the KORCAD (RCA Distribution Company). The first ever Korean television drama, 천국의 문 (The Gates of Heaven) 
        debuted the same year, planning director Choi Chang-Bong spent two and a half months continuously fixing the script, 
        preparing sets and even the first instance of special effects, all for a drama that lasted no longer than fifteen minutes.</p>
    <p class="lead">The early 1960s saw a phenomenal growth in television broadcasting. On 1 October 1961 the first full-scale television station, 
        HLKA-TV (now known as KBS 1TV), was established and began operation under the Ministry of Culture and Public Information.</p>
    <p class="lead">Following KBS was Tongyang Broadcasting Corporation's TBC-TV which was launched in 1964, 
        and ran until merged in 1980. It was the first private television network in South Korea.</p>
    <p class="lead">The second commercial television system, MBC-TV, made its debut in 1969. 
        The advent of MBC-TV brought significant development to the television industry in Korea and 
        after 1969 the television industry was characterized by furious competition among the three networks.</p>
