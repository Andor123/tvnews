    <h1 class="h1">Television in Puerto Rico</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">During the 1950s the impending arrival of television created public expectation in Puerto Rico, 
        even influencing other entertainment mediums in the form of a song. WKAQ-TV was the first station to introduce regular programing in 1954, 
        followed closely by WAPA-TV. The owners of these stations, Ángel Ramos and José Ramón Quiñones, brought their experience in the newspaper 
        and radio industries to the new medium. The competition between WKAQ and WAPA would continue for decades, 
        with both disputing the milestones of first videotape in 1966, first color transmission and satellite transmission in 1968. 
        During decades, the ratings were dominated by local programming produced by Tommy Muñiz and Paquito Cordero, which adopted a family friendly approach. 
        However, the retirement of the former, combined with the introduction of cable television and the acquisition of the largest stations 
        by foreign interest brought changes in content beginning in the 1980s, with late-night shows and double entendre gaining prominence. 
        Digital television was introduced to the market in 2009, widely displacing analog television.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">On July 24, 1952, Ángel Ramos received approval from the FCC to create his own station within four years. 
        José Ramón Quiñones received his on August 12, 1952. On February 12, 1954, El Mundo Broadcasting Company and WKAQ-TV officially received its license to operate channel 2. 
        Ponce de León Broadcasting Company and WAPA-TV received channel 4 on March 15, 1954. Heavy publicity preceded the inauguration of WKAQ-TV 
        with El Mundo serving as its main outlet, but the inauguration suffered postponement to March due to a delay in the arrival of a 
        transmission tower and meanwhile a static image of a native man would be in place. It was then assembled at Marquesa mountain in Aguas Buenas, 
        some 2,000 feet above sea level. The frequency was set to 100,000 watts. The station would become the first local transmitter, 
        with its first show being aired at 6:30 p.m. on March 28, 1954, from San Juan. Puerto Rican star Mapy Cortés appeared along her husband Fernando 
        in the first programs when the medium was inaugurated. WAPA-TV tested images and commercials in February 25 and March 5, even airing 
        an interview with Felisa Rincón de Gautier hosted by Carlos Rubén Ortiz and Enrique Soler, but did not follow it. WAPA-TV would introduce its programming on May 1, 1954. 
        Most of the publicity surrounded WKAQ-TV, with El Mundo being particularly sympathetic to owner Ángel Ramos despite other stations emerging. 
        El Imparcial, in response, gave its publicity to WAPA-TV and its owner José R. Quiñones, who adopted an educational and religious approach in its programming. 
        Alma Latina magazine gave coverage to all.</p>
    <p class="lead">In 1973, telenovela actor José Reymundí began a strike against Producciones Tommy Muñiz and in particular against its administrator Hernan Nigaglioni, 
        claiming that he had been left out of a local production to favor foreigners. Soon afterwards, he was joined by more people as APATE joined and people 
        like Castro decided not to cross the protest lines, while others like Candal actively joined the protests. Morales in turn decided to quit on the air. 
        Only Alida Arizmendi challenged the protests. WAPA-TV decided not to intervene and distanced itself from the issue. In the end, Muñiz granted the demands of the protestors, 
        such as health coverage or six-month contracts, but Reymundí was unable to benefit due to the cancellation of the production due to the strike. 
        Producciones Tommy Muñiz was affected by it, with only productions like Esto no tiene nombre or Ja-ja, ji-ji, jo-jo con Agrelot surviving. 
        Candal, Morales, Warrington, Carbia, Molina and García left to create Producciones Astra and joined Channel 7. This would only last for some years, 
        since the company gained a reputation as supporting work syndicates and were avoided.</p>
