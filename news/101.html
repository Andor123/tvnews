    <p class="lead">Fiji Television Limited is one of Fiji's main television networks. 
        It was founded on 15 June 1994 as the first permanent commercial television broadcasting network in the country, 
        although television had previously been introduced temporarily in October 1991 to broadcast the Rugby World Cup 
        as well as Cricket World Cup. This was reviewed and reissued in 2000 for a term of 12 years. Fiji TV was listed 
        as a public company in 1996 on the Suva Stock Exchange, now known as the South Pacific Stock Exchange.</p>
    <p class="lead">The Fijian Broadcasting Corporation (FBC) is one of the two radio broadcasters in Fiji. 
        It was known as Fiji Broadcasting Commission when it began. It traces its history to 1935 when it first began operating under 
        licence from the Posts and Telegraphs Department with the call sign ZJV. At the end of 1952, the legislative council passed 
        the Broadcasting Commission Bill. The commission members were appointed in June 1953. On 1 July 1954, the commission's first programme 
        was broadcast as part of the official opening ceremony.</p>
    <p class="lead">Mai TV is a commercial free-to-air TV network based in the Fiji Islands. The company was founded in 2006 by Richard Broadbridge 
        and began broadcasts in June 2008. It is full privately owned and broadcasts to 100% of the Fiji group of islands. 
        Mai TV's head office is at Garden City Suva.</p>
    <p class="lead">Pacific Broadcasting Services was a company jointly owned by City West Centre Broadcasting Services and BPHCL. 
        Its core business is to deliver satellite subscription television and radio broadcasting services to the Fiji Islands 
        and surrounding markets, focussing on both Hindi and English speaking households and commercial outlets.</p>
