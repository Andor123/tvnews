    <h1 class="h1">Television in South Africa</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in South Africa was introduced in 1976. The country is notable for its late adoption of widespread television broadcasting.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">Opposition leader K. Ueckermann was the first politician to propose a television service for the SABC, 
        submitting a question to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, J. F. Naudé, on 6 April 1951. The SABC had set goals for television as early as 1944.</p>
    <p class="lead">The broadcaster later reiterated that introducing a television service was considered too costly, 
        especially given the early global developments in television technology, whose impact was still being studied. 
        In 1952, Naudé stated that South Africa was interested in developing its own television service in the future. 
        However, at the time, the costs were still seen as prohibitive for the government.</p>
    <p class="lead">In 1971, the SABC was finally allowed to introduce a television service. 
        Initially, the proposal was for two television channels—one in English and Afrikaans, 
        alternating between the two languages and aimed at white audiences, and another, 
        known as TV Bantu, aimed at black viewers. TV Bantu never launched.</p>
    <p class="lead">Test transmissions in Johannesburg began on 5 May 1975, followed by test broadcasts in Cape Town and Durban in July. 
        Nationwide services finally commenced on 5 January 1976, with only one channel, the English/Afrikaans service.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Programming</h2>
    <p class="lead">Many imported programmes were dubbed into Afrikaans, some of the first being the British detective series The Sweeney (known in Afrikaans as Blitspatrollie) 
        and Van der Valk, as well as the puppet series Thunderbirds. However, in July 1986, to accommodate English speakers, 
        the SABC began to simulcast the original soundtrack of American series on an FM radio service called Radio 2000. 
        These included Miami Vice (known as Misdaad in Miami).</p>
    <p class="lead">The first locally produced TV programmes in South Africa were in English and Afrikaans. English-language programmes included the 
        family drama series The Dingleys and The Villagers, as well as the comedy series Biltong and Potroast, featuring South African and British comedians, 
        and the variety programme The Knicky Knacky Knoo Show. Other programmes included the children's series Bangalory Time, 
        the music series Pop Shop, and the sports programme Sportsview.</p>
