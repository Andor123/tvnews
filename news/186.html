    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Broadcast stations: government-dominated; the National Communications Network (NCN) TV is state-owned; 
        a few private TV stations relay satellite services (2007).</p>
    <p class="lead">Censorship: No government-imposed restrictions on television stations or suspensions of broadcasts in 2012. 
        The government largely directs advertising to media houses aligned with the governing party. 
        The government continues to exert heavy control over the content of the National Communications Network (TV), 
        giving government spokespersons extended coverage, while limiting participation of opposition figures.</p>
    <p class="lead">The first television station in Guyana was established in 1988, using a transmitter obtained from Canada. 
        Many households already could watch TV programs from the US, through "pirate re-transmitting stations" and the use of receiving dishes. 
        Guyana was the first English-speaking Caribbean country to install a USIA TVRO, which sent broadcast signals from Washington D.C. 
        In the 70s and 80s, information dissemination continued to favor the North due to infrastructures established in the colonial period. 
        The MacBride report in 1980 was an attempt to discuss the imbalance between advantaged countries such as the US and the UK, and 
        developing states like Guyana, that don't have the capacity for controlling information flow between their borders.</p>
    <p class="lead">Broadcasting is regulated by the Guyana National Broadcasting Authority (GNBA), a body established by the Broadcasting Act of 2011. 
        The Broadcast (Amendment) Bill 2017 was made to guarantee a certain amount of broadcast hours to government public service announcements, 
        however this was seen as a threat to free speech, since such PSAs were typically serving the political party in power, rather than the public.</p>
