    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">The television division of RTTL is known as Televisão de 
        Timor Leste or Televizaun Timor Lorosae (East Timor Television), abbreviated as TVTL. 
        Its schedule consists of some locally made programs in Tetum, as well as relay of 
        news programmes and others from RTP Internacional. In the past it occasionally broadcast 
        a few programmes from ABC Australia, and BBC World News. In September 2008, it signed an agreement 
        with Brazil's TV Globo, allowing its access to that channel's programming until year-end 2014, 
        in a package worth 3,000 hours of content. The package started with the 2006 version of Sinhá Moça, 
        and by the end of 2009 planned to air non-telenovela formats, A Diarista, A Grande Família, Malhação and Sítio do Pica-Pau Amarelo.</p>
    <p class="lead">TVTL began broadcast in 1978, first as the East Timor station of TVRI and was later renamed as TV UNTAET. 
        Following independence on 20 May 2002, it adopted its present name. It absorbed the former TVRI transmitter on channel 7, 
        as well as having a relay station on channel 12 in Baucau.</p>
