    <h1 class="h1">Television in Indonesia</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Indonesia started in 1962 (during the opening ceremony of the 1962 Asian Games), 
        when the then state-run station TVRI began broadcasting â€“ the third country in Southeast Asia to do so. 
        TVRI held a television monopoly in Indonesia until 1989 when the first commercial station, 
        RCTI began as a local station and was subsequently granted a national license a year later. 
        The Indonesian television is regulated by both Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs (Komdigi) 
        for frequency matters and Indonesian Broadcasting Commission (KPI) for content matters.</p>
    <p class="lead">Each of the networks have a wide variety of programmes, ranging from traditional shows, 
        such as wayang performances, to Western-based programmes such as Indonesian Idol, Family Feud, MasterChef, 
        Top Model and The Voice. One typical television show common to almost every network is sinetron. 
        Sinetron is usually a drama series, following the soap opera format, but can also refer to any fictional series. 
        Sometimes it can be comedic, like the popular Bajaj Bajuri series, featuring a bajaj driver and the people he drives around.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">The first time the Indonesian public witnessed the demonstration of a television was in 1955 in Yogyakarta, 
        during a municipal fair commemorating the city's bicentennial (Republican spelling Indonesian: Pekan Raja 200 Tahun Kota Jogjakarta). 
        These first televisions were brought from the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p class="lead">However, the initial idea to establish a television station in Indonesia was put 
        forward by then Minister of Information Maladi as far as 1952. The argument is that the station would be useful for 
        the socialization of the upcoming 1955 general election, but the idea was failed because the idea was deemed as too expensive by the cabinet.</p>
    <p class="lead">As the only TV station in Indonesia for many years, aside from coverage of state events, sessions of the 
        People's Consultative Assembly and national holidays, as well as news, educational programming and regional programs 
        in the many regional languages, TVRI had also broadcast entertainment, child-oriented and sports programmes to suit the needs of the viewing public. 
        As part of the plans of the Fifth Development Cabinet, however, noticing how its ASEAN neighbours had operated private television channels 
        with success (Malaysia had its own by then sole private TV channel TV3, which opened in 1984 and the Philippines and Thailand also 
        had private TV stations in conjunction with the state networks, while TVRI was by then in the same situation as in 
        Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia and Brunei which all had only a state TV channel while Vietnam had both national and state-sponsored regional stations), 
        the door was opened for the formation of private television stations and an end to the TVRI monopoly, 
        while the former was starting to become a true national network when it launched TVRI Program 2 (Programma 2), 
        which signed on on April 1, 1989, as the Metro Jakarta station offering both national programming and local productions.</p>
