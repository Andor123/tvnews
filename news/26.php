    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Sweden began in Sweden in
        1954 with the first test transmissions,
        prior to the opening of the first station, Radiotj√§nst,
        two years later. A second channel was launched in 1969.
        Commercial television arrived in the 1980s through cable
        television and in 1992, the country's first terrestrial
        commercial channel was launched.</p>
    <p class="lead">The shutdown of the PAL analogue service
        in Sweden started on September 19, 2005,
        and was finished on October 15, 2007.</p>
    <p class="lead">Typically, non-Swedish content maintains the
        original language soundtrack while subtitled into Swedish.
        This includes foreign interviews embedded into news and
        magazine programmes as well as SVT's Finnish news bulletin
        (Uutiset). Conversely, interview responses given in Swedish aired
        on Finnish or Sami news bulletins are subtitled into the main
        language of that respective bulletin. Non-Swedish programming
        intended for children is, however, usually dubbed into Swedish.
        Regardless of intended audience, some shows receive a Swedish title,
        which is used in programme schedules.</p>
    <p class="lead">Many of the channels targeting Sweden are not actually
        broadcasting from Sweden, but from other countries
        (mostly from the United Kingdom). This is done to avoid the Swedish
        Broadcasting Law which restricts advertising heavily.</p>
    <p class="lead">In addition to the channels listed below,
        viewers close to the border with Norway, Denmark or Finland can receive
        channels from those respective countries as a result of signal spillover
        and some satellite subscription packages offer
        some channels from these countries.</p>
