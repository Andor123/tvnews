    <h1 class="h1">Television in El Salvador</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in El Salvador began in 1956 in black and white on YSEB-TV, which would bring attention to the radio broadcasting industry in the 1960s. 
        It was so much so that it was part of the Salvadoran Association Broadcasting (ASDER) in 1964 to confront stagnation, 
        in response to the political crisis during the era of military authoritarianism. Since the birth of privatization, 
        Salvadoran television survived with the support of viewers and the growth of the industry that became part of one of the most important media. 
        Currently, there are 42 television channel concessions in total: 35 of these are private, five religious and two public. 
        In addition, eighteen television channels have national coverage and 24 channels are regional; including international television services, 
        normally distributed by cable and satellite. Salvadoran television is in charge of the General Superintendency of Electricity and Telecommunications (SIGET) since 1996, 
        being the successor of the National Telecommunications Administration (ANTEL).</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">The first attempts to create television were made by the Mexican Rubén González on his own initiative in April 1956. 
        In the same month, Boris Eserski, Guillermo Pinto and Tono Alfaro, former owners of the YSEB radio station, collaborated in this creation. 
        The first television channel launched was YSEB-TV, now known as Canal 6 was launched on 7 September 1956 as a public channel that lasted for ten years; 
        Its programming was very short by transmitting for two hours, and it only covered the city of San Salvador; and later Canal 8 would share its signal from 1958 to 1963. 
        Canal 4 began as the second public channel that lasted from 1959 to 1963, which turned into a private channel in 1966 and the first channel with national coverage; 
        Three channels were parts of Telecentro, which was the first conglomerate company for more than one channel until its dissolution in 1966.</p>
    <p class="lead">Later it was founded as a successor to two former public stations called Televisión Educativa de El Salvador (Canal 10) from 1964 to 1968, 
        and would return transmitting with Canal 8 on 29 January 1973; which those two channels lasted until 1989 when Canal 8 went signed off, 
        leaving Canal 10 the only public TV channel at the time. However, the first private Salvadoran television channel is Canal 2 which was launched 
        in 1965 on the basis of the radio station Circuito YSR. And due to the stagnation of having only this channel and Canal 4, 
        this amount lasted until Canal 6 was relaunched on 6 April 1973 as the third private channel and the first full-time color television channel using the NTSC-M format. 
        Although three years before due to geographical reasons it was only transmitted in the western zone on the Guatemalan signal, 
        and Canal 4 began its transmissions as a part-time transmission in color from 3 March 1973 until the channel was completely adopted in the FIFA World Cup 1974. 
        With this innovation in the television system, all television channels throughout the 1970s switched to color screens.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Salvadoran TV channels</h2>
    <p class="lead">In El Salvador, there are many religious television shows and many telenovelas. El Salvador is served by three national television corporations (TCS, RSM and Megavisión), 
        two state-run channels (Canal 10 and Televisión Legislativa) and many minor and regional channels.</p>
