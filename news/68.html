    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Sri Lanka dates back to 1979. Television broadcasting, 
        like other forms of media in the country, is generally divided along linguistic lines 
        with state and private media operators providing services in Sinhala, Tamil, and English languages.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">Preliminary work was underway in the first half of the 1970s.</p>
    <p class="lead">Businessmen Anil Wijewardena and Shan Wickremasinghe established the country's 
        first TV station Independent Television Network which started broadcasting on 15 April 1979. 
        The new station remained independent for less than two months as the government took control of 
        it on 5 June 1979 following a dispute with President J. R. Jayewardene. 
        Sri Lanka's second state-owned TV station - Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) - was established by 
        the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation Act No. 6 of 1982. SLRC started broadcasting on 15 February 1982. 
        The Act required the SLRC to maintain taste and decency and not to incite crime and disorder or cause religious or public offence.</p>
    <p class="lead">The government maintained a monopoly on television broadcasting until 1992 
        when private TV stations were allowed to broadcast but they were to be regulated by the SLRC. 
        Maharaja Television (MTV), a joint venture between Capital Maharaja and Singapore Telecommunications Limited, 
        was one of the first private TV stations. Since then many new TV stations have started in Sri Lanka. 
        There are also a number of satellite networks and pay per view television networks in Sri Lanka. 
        The national telecommunications provider Sri Lanka Telecom also launched an IPTV service in 2008.</p>
