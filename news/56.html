    <h1 class="h1">Television in Turkmenistan</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">In Turkmenistan, television has been operating for over 50 years 
        and is subject to vigorous state censorship. Notorious for a totalitarian control on media, 
        Turkmenistan has consistently occupied one among the last three spots of 
        the annual Press Freedom Index since its inception in 2006.</p>
    <p class="lead">There are 8 television channels — Altyn Asyr, Yashlyk (Yaşlyk), 
        Miras, The Turkmenistan TV Channel, Türkmen Owazy, Ashgabat TV, Arkadag TV and Turkmenistan Sport. 
        All of them used to be under the aegis of Ministry of Culture and Broadcasting of Turkmenistan, 
        before being subsumed under the jurisdiction of the State Committee of Turkmenistan on 
        TV, Radio and Film on 17 October 2011. The channels broadcast from Yamal 201, before 
        shifting to their indigenous satellite TürkmenÄlem 52oE.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">The first television broadcast in Turkmenistan was held on 7 November 1959 
        when the Ashgabat television center conducted its first test broadcasts, mostly movies. 
        The center would only start airing a regular service upon completion of its facilities.</p>
    <p class="lead">The Turkmen government took over the extant television network from the former Turkmen SSR. 
        The state company was renamed TMT (after the initials in Turkmen for Turkmenistan National Television). 
        Russophone viewers frequently nicknamed the company as "your dead TV" (твой мертвый телевизор).</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Cable and satellite television</h2>
    <p class="lead">A limited number of foreign news channels (among them Euronews, France 24 and BBC News) 
        are available on cable. A 2024 AFP report to Turkmenistan reveals that cable television operators 
        are widely used as means of escape from the "boring" nature of state TV. 
        Audience is minimal due to low proficiency of the English language. 
        The Turkmen state controls information and receives income from subscriptions. 
        Starting in 2014, the state started IPTV alternatives. 
        Subscriptions in 2018 cost 10 manats (US$2.80 at official rate, comparable to US $0.50 at the black market rate). 
        Russian and Turkish networks are also available.</p>
