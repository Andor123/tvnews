    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">While newspapers (and, most recently, blogging) have long thrived in Nigeria, radio and television has not received as much recognition, 
        due to limited resources and press restrictions which beset the establishment of radio or television services in Nigeria. 
        However, such limitations have since been improved in order to reach larger audiences both within and without Nigeria, 
        such as with the growth of satellite television. The BBC World Service as well as the Voice of America and the German broadcasting 
        organization Deutsche Welle (DW) also provide shortwave radio in the Hausa language.</p>
    <p class="lead">The first terrestrial television broadcast signals in Nigeria occurred on Saturday October 31, 1959 
        and belonged to the Western Nigeria Television Service (WNTS). Nigeria was one of the first countries to introduce 
        television broadcasting in Africa. Nigeria also has the largest terrestrial television network in 
        Africa which is the Nigerian Television Authority (with over 96 stations scattered around the country). 
        As of 2010, 40% of Nigerian population had television in their homes.</p>
