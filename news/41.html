    <h1 class="h1">Television in Andorra</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">The first legal television broadcasts in Andorra date back to the 1970s. 
        The Andorran television scene is the direct result of the country's complex history,
         which can be explained by the balanced cultural, 
         political and social relations of the European microstate with the two neighboring countries, 
         France and Spain. Thus, Andorra had first time a color television input, 
         although for a while it shared the signal with black and white. 
         The incorporation of the country into the digital era was, however, 
         quite leading. Andorra is the third European country, after Finland and Luxembourg, 
         to have switched off the analogue signal. 
         The Andorran television channel Andorra Televisi√≥ was launched in 1995.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">Having political conflicts with its neighbours over the 
        implementation of telegraph, telephone and radio, 
        made the introduction of television in Andorra very late.</p>
    <p class="lead">There is news from the 1950s about the use of televisions in Andorran bars.
         But it was not until the arrival of color television, 
         introduced in France before Spain, that the Andorran authorities decided 
         to take an interest in television. Therefore, the Andorran Parliament, 
         which had its own government only since the 1980s, 
         decided in 1967 to contact the French co-prince in order 
         to find out how to obtain permits and licenses to broadcast television in Andorra.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Digital terrestrial television</h2>
    <p class="lead">On 25 September 2007 at 11pm, Andorra became one of the first European countries 
        to switch off all terrestrial analogue transmissions, making TDT the only method of 
        terrestrial TV reception in the country. The service is operated jointly by 
        the Andorran Government and the country's telecommunications company Andorra Telecom. 
        As well as offering Andorra's only TV Channel ATV, the service offers various channels 
        from Spain and France. It is also one of the few terrestrial television services 
        to offer the BBC World News channel.</p>
