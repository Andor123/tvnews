    <p class="lead">Television in Croatia was first introduced in 1956.
        As of 2012 there are 10 nationwide and 21 regional DVB-T
        (Digital Video Broadcasting – Terrestrial) television channels,
        and more than 30 other channels either produced in the
        Republic of Croatia or produced for the Croatian market
        and broadcast via IPTV (Internet Protocol television),
        cable or satellite television.
        The electronic communications market in Croatia is
        regulated by the Croatian Regulatory Authority for Network Industries (HAKOM),
        which issues broadcast licenses and monitors the market.
        The DVB-T and satellite transmission infrastructure is developed
        and maintained by the state-owned company Odašiljači i veze (OiV).</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Nationwide channels</h2>
    <p class="lead">As of May 2014, there are eleven nationwide free-to-air DVB-T television channels,
        with HRT's four channels, RTL Televizija operating three,
        Nova TV operating two and the remaining two operated by the
        Croatian Olympic Committee and Author d.o.o. companies and the government's
        Central State Administrative Office for e-Croatia.
        All ten DVB-T television channels are free-to-air and privately owned,
        except for HRT's channels and the Moja uprava channel
        (which are publicly owned broadcasters).
        Doma TV is part of the Nova TV group.
        Since 2007 television audience measurement is conducted by
        the Nielsen Company using 1,086 peoplemeters,
        and it is applied to terrestrial, cable and satellite TV.
        As of January 2012 HRT, RTL Televizija and Nova TV are using the service.</p>
    <p class="lead">HRT 1, Nova TV and RTL Televizija channels' programmes are not specialized
        and comprise news, a variety of scripted and unscripted entertainment,
        as well as documentaries. HRT2, Doma TV and RTL 2 channels, carry similar
        type of programmes, except for absence of news.
        In addition, Croatian Radiotelevision is legally required to
        produce and broadcast programmes covering education of youths,
        aimed at the Croatian diaspora, national minorities in Croatia,
        preservation of cultural and natural heritage,
        protection of the environment, promotion of democracy and civil society,
        and support national production of films, television programme and music.
        Other nationwide channels are specialized providing informational programmes,
        covering sports or music.</p>
