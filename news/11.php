    <p class="lead">Television in North Macedonia was first introduced in 1964;
        it remains the most popular news medium. The public broadcaster is
        the Macedonian Radio-Television, founded in 1993. TEKO TV (1989)
        from Å tip is the first private television channel in the country.
        Other popular private channels are: Sitel, Kanal 5, Telma, Alfa TV,
        and Alsat-M.Most private media are tied to political or business
        interests and state media tend to support the government.
        Public broadcast networks face stiff competition from commercial
        stations, which dominate the ratings. A European Union sponsored report
        says that with scores of TV and radio networks, the market is overcrowded
        and many local broadcasters are struggling to survive financially.</p>
