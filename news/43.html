    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">On 15 August 2008, 1 FL TV began operation after being licensed 
        by the Liechtenstein government under the leadership of businessman Peter Kölbel. 
        It broadcasts in German and is a business venture led by 
        Austrian businesswoman Beatrix Schartl after Kölbel's death.</p>
    <p class="lead">Liechtenstein showed interest in participating in the 
        Eurovision Song Contest in 1969 and 1976. Despite this, it was not possible because 
        at the time Liechtenstein did not have a television station based in that country. 
        If 1 FL TV becomes an active member of the European Broadcasting Union, 
        then Liechtenstein may have its national representation in Eurovision. 
        There are financial costs associated with EBU membership. 
        On 9 August 2022, the managing director of 1 FL TV, Sandra Woldt, 
        announced that the company would no longer seek EBU membership 
        and participation in the Eurovision Song Contest. 
        Instead, they would concentrate on reporting in their own country. 
        It was announced in 2024 that Radio Liechtenstein was applying for 
        EBU membership instead, but as no radio-only broadcaster has become a 
        participant in the Eurovision Song Contest, this would not necessarily 
        have solved Liechtenstein's participation problem, even if 
        Radio Liechtenstein had not ceased operating in 2025.</p>
