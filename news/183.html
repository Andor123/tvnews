    <h1 class="h1">Television in Panama</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television was introduced to Panama extra-officially in 1956 with the start of SCN in the Panama Canal Zone and officially on March 14, 1960, 
        with the launch of RPC Televisión. Currently Corporación MEDCOM and TVN Media dominate the landscape.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">With the support of American engineers, RPC Televisión started broadcasting on March 14, 1960, owned by Radio Programas Continentales. 
        Its inaugural acts had the participation of President Ernesto de la Guardia, as well as other political personalities of the time. 
        It broadcast from 4:30pm to 11pm, with an abundant quantity of live programs and two news bulletins. 
        There was also coverage of the 1960 presidential elections, held in May of that year.</p>
    <p class="lead">Following the 1968 Panamanian coup d'état, new technologies were being implemented. In the early 1970s, 
        live sporting events became a possibility thanks to satellite technologies, while TVN became the first in Panama to broadcast in color in 1972. 
        That same year, the two Panamanian networks broadcast a sum of 180 hours and 45 minutes per week, with 71.6% consisting of imports 
        and the remaining 28.4% produced in Panama. A closed circuit educational television station started operations 
        in November 1973 in the University of Panama before becoming a channel in its own right, Televisión Educativa Experimental, 
        the current SERTV, on January 22, 1978, on channel 6, later moving to channel 11.</p>
    <p class="lead">Changes to the legislation were enacted in 1980, breaking the commercial monopoly of the Eleta and Chiari families. 
        The passing of Law 36 in the Official Gazette in 1980 gave licenses to Panavisión del Istmo, of Vice-president Ricardo de la Espriella, 
        on channel 5 in Panamá Province and Medios Panameños, of ex-chancellor Nicolás González Revilla, 
        gained channel 13 in the metropolitan area of the capital, creating Telemetro. Telemetro started on October 13, 1981 
        as a subscription television channel with a six-hour schedule of three movies, mostly vintage. A relay station in Colón was installed in 1983, 
        before achieving total national coverage in 1992. Panavisión, on its hand, started broadcasting on October 21, 1983. 
        Within a year, Panavisión had already set up relay stations to cover all nine provinces.</p>
    <p class="lead">On December 25, 1989 (Christmas Day), RPC is authorized to return to the air, but its programming was limited to a special Christmas mass. 
        In the days that followed, the only program that was broadcast was Los del Camino, a daily reflection produced by the Catholic Church. 
        In April, TVN, Telecinco and Telemetro returned to the air, but with the same limitations imposed to RPC.</p>
