    <h2 class="h2">Analog television</h2>
    <p class="lead">Television in Slovenia was first introduced in 1958.
        The first TV station in Slovenia was launched by JRT RTV Ljubljana
        (now RTV Slovenija) in 1958 as TV Ljubljana 1 (now TV Slovenija 1).
        In 1970 TV Ljubljana 2 (now TV Slovenija 2) was launched and TV Slovenija 3 in 2008.
        The first private TV station Kanal A was launched in May 1991.
        The second private channel POP TV was launched by the company PRO PLUS d.o.o.
        in December 1995. TV3 was also launched in 1995, and was originally owned by
        the Roman Catholic Church. It had a poor viewership until Ivan Caleta,
        a businessman from Croatia, purchased 75% ownership of the channel in 2003,
        and started to offer more popular programming. Kanal A became the sister channel
        of POP TV in 2001, when Pro Plus took over the channel. TV3 became the new player
        on the market, when Swedish company MTG bought it in 2006. On 29 February 2012,
        it ceased broadcasting due to uncompetitive environment and unresponsiveness of Slovenian authorities.
        Slovenia used the analogue PAL standard until December 1, 2010
        when analog broadcasting ceased and was replaced with DVB-T.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">DVB-T</h2>
    <p class="lead">Experimental DVB-T broadcasts began in 2001 using the MPEG-2 standard.
        In 2007 the Slovenian government decided to test DVB-T transmission in
        Ljubljana using the MPEG-4 standard, following the approval of the APEK
        (Agency for Post and Telecommunications Republic of Slovenia).
        After that Radiotelevizija Slovenija had to determine which transmitter
        would be used for the 3-month test. They settled on the transmitters made by a
        Slovene company, Elti, who produces analog and digital TV transmitters.
        After the test, the RTV SLO decided to expand transmissions to TV SLO 2.
        In 2008, the RTV SLO launched a new channel: TV SLO 3 (a public affairs broadcast)
        to its digital offering. High-definition broadcast with AC-3 was experimented
        during the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympic Games. The 2010 Winter Olympic Games were also broadcast in HD.
        Currently, there are two multiplexes operating, Mux A and Mux C.</p>
