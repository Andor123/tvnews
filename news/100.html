    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in New Zealand was introduced in 1960 as a state-run service. 
        The broadcasting sector was deregulated in 1989, when the Government allowed competition 
        to the state-owned TVNZ (Television New Zealand). There are currently three forms of broadcast television: 
        a terrestrial (DVB-T) service provided by Freeview; as well as satellite (DVB-S) and internet streaming (IPTV) 
        services provided nationwide by both Freeview and Sky.</p>
    <p class="lead">The first nationwide digital television service was launched in December 1998 by Sky, 
        who had a monopoly on digital satellite television until the launch of Freeview's nationwide digital satellite service in May 2007. 
        The Freeview digital terrestrial service launched on 14 April 2008. A pay digital terrestrial service was launched in 2012 
        by Igloo and closed in 2017; this was a joint venture between Sky and TVNZ and provided 
        Freeview UHF aerial channels along with eleven Sky channels. In July 2016, Sky announced that Igloo will 
        be discontinued although Freeview channels will still be available. Up until 2023, Vodafone (now One NZ) 
        operated an IPTV television service, with free-to-air channels and wholesale content from Sky.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">Full-time television broadcasting was first introduced in New Zealand in 1960 and transmitted 
        from the NZBC's existing 1YA radio broadcasting facility at 74 Shortland Street in Auckland, now home 
        to the University of Auckland's Gus Fisher Gallery. The annual television licence fee was Â£NZ4 ($8). 
        Prime Minister Walter Nash had made a surprise announcement (a surprise both to the NZBS and to other members 
        of the Labour government) in London in November 1959 that New Zealand would have television within twelve months; 
        the system was to be state-owned but to carry commercials, and would be introduced in stages in the four main centres. 
        The first non-experimental programme was transmitted on Wednesday 1 June 1960.</p>
    <p class="lead">New Zealand, like Australia and most of western Europe, adopted the 625-line standard for television. 
        In contrast, United Kingdom used the 405-line standard exclusively until 1964.</p>
    <p class="lead">Initially, programming was done on a regional basis, with different services broadcasting from the main cities, 
        AKTV2 in Auckland, being the first on 1 June 1960, followed in 1961 by CHTV3 in Christchurch on 1 June and WNTV1 
        in Wellington on 1 July, and then DNTV2 in Dunedin on 31 July 1962. There was no network between the stations at the time; 
        tapes of shows were transferred between each station for broadcast, usually starting in Auckland and working their way south to Dunedin. 
        Today, however, programming and scheduling is done in Auckland where all the major networks are now headquartered.</p>
