    <p class="lead">In 1980, a television unit was established in Bel Eau to produce video programs for the Ministry of Education; 
        On 1 January 1983 the first public television service was launched with Radio Television Seychelles (RTS), 
        broadcasting from Hermitage every weekend from Friday to Sunday.</p>
    <p class="lead">In 1986, TV was already accessible to approximately 98% of the population, having now achieved almost complete coverage. 
        In 1989 RTS Television began broadcasting 7 days a week. Thanks to the installation of a satellite dish at the Hermitage in 1991, 
        Seychellois viewers could watch CNN, which was relayed by RTS.</p>
    <p class="lead">In March 2010 SBC renewed its television programming, placing greater attention on the production of local programs. 
        Seasonal programs were introduced and the schedule was extended to 24 hours thanks to the advent of an automatic broadcasting system.</p>
    <p class="lead">On June 28, 2018, SBC switched to digital television technology, 
        bringing its bouquet to 10 TV channels and 4 radio stations, all free.</p>
