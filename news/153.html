    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television is a popular form of mass media in Zambia, with approximately 67 percent of people watching television on a regular basis. 
        Some television channels after multilingual and some are specifically English-only channels. There are both privately-owned media and government-owned media. 
        In the early 2010s there was a shift from analogue television broadcasting to digital television. 
        Considering the expensive nature of switching to digital programming, the Zambian government sought out the help of foreign investment. 
        The investment towards the shift was led both by the Zambian government and a leading Chinese media conglomerate, StarTimes, helped provide the digital signals. 
        StarTimes owns about 60 percent of the media signaling with the government-owned broadcasting service the Zambian National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) 
        owning the other 40 percent. Through the shift to digital programming, there has been an increase in the number of channels now available 
        to the Zambian public that was not before. There is possible concern, however, that the prospect of new channels has not been used to promote local programs 
        but instead has served to give a platform for Chinese media content.</p>
    <p class="lead">Privately owned television channels dominate the majority of the television channels, with around 42 channels being privately owned. 
        The Zambian National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC), which is government-run, owns three different television channels. 
        The ZNBC provides their content through traditional television, radio, as well as live streaming. According to the Information and Broadcast Services Minister Dora Siliya, 
        the ZNBC channels are the most popular among Zambian citizens. It is considered to be the most consumed form of broadcast news in Zambia because 
        it is a publicly -owned station and therefore the signal it operates on is public and more widely accessible.</p>
