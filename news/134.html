    <p class="lead">State-owned Cameroon Radio Television (CRTV), 2 private TV broadcasters (2007).</p>
    <p class="lead">One station (2001).</p>
    <p class="lead">The government maintains tight control over broadcast media. State-owned Cameroon Radio Television (CRTV), 
        operates both a TV and a radio network. It was the only officially recognized and fully licensed broadcaster until August 2007 
        when the government issued licenses to two private TV and one private radio broadcasters.</p>
    <p class="lead">Approximately 375 privately owned radio stations were operating in 2012, three-fourths of them in Yaounde and Douala. 
        The government requires nonprofit rural radio stations to submit applications to broadcast, but they were exempt from licensing fees. 
        Commercial radio and television broadcasters must submit a licensing application and pay an application fee 
        and thereafter pay a high annual licensing fee. Several rural community radio stations function with foreign funding. 
        The government prohibits these stations from discussing politics.</p>
    <p class="lead">In spite of the government's tight control, Reporters Without Borders reported in 
        its 2011 field survey that "[i]t is clear from the diversity of the media and the outspoken reporting style that press freedom is a reality".</p>
