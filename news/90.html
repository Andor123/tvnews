    <h1 class="h1">Television in Japan</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Japan was introduced in 1939. However, experiments date back to the 1920s, 
        with Kenjiro Takayanagi's pioneering experiments in electronic television. Television broadcasting was halted by World War II, 
        after which regular television broadcasting began in 1950. After Japan developed the first HDTV systems in the 1960s, 
        MUSE/Hi-Vision was introduced in the 1970s.</p>
    <p class="lead">A modified version of the NTSC system for analog signals, called NTSC-J, 
        was used for analog broadcast between 1950 and the early 2010s. The analog broadcast in Japan was replaced 
        with a digital broadcasts using the ISDB standard. ISDB supersedes both the NTSC-J analog television system 
        and the previously used MUSE Hi-vision analog HDTV system in Japan. Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting (DTTB) 
        services using ISDB-T (ISDB-T International) started in Japan in December 2003, and since then, 
        Japan adopted ISDB over other digital broadcasting standards.</p>
    <p class="lead">All Japanese households having at least one television set, or any device that is capable of receiving live 
        television broadcasts, are mandated to hold a television license, with funds primarily used to subsidize NHK, 
        the Japanese public service broadcaster. The fee varies from ¥12,276 to ¥21,765 (reduced to ¥10,778 to ¥20,267 
        for households residing in Okinawa Prefecture) depending on the method and timing of payment, and on whether one receives 
        only terrestrial television or also satellite broadcasts. Households on welfare may be excused from the license fee. 
        Notably, there is no legal authority to impose sanctions or fines in the event of non-payment; people may (and many do) 
        throw away the bills and turn away the occasional bill collector, without consequence.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">In 1924, Kenjiro Takayanagi began a research program on electronic television. 
        In 1925, he demonstrated a cathode ray tube (CRT) television with thermal electron emission. 
        Television tests were conducted in 1926 using a combined mechanical Nipkow disk and electronic Braun tube system. 
        In 1926, he demonstrated a CRT television with 40-line resolution, the first working example of a fully electronic television receiver. 
        In 1927, he increased the television resolution to 100 lines, which was unrivaled until 1931. In 1928, he was the first 
        to transmit human faces in half-tones on television.</p>
    <p class="lead">In the same period Takayanagi also turned his interest to television studies after having 
        learned about the new technology in a French magazine. He developed a system similar to that of John Logie Baird, 
        using the Nipkow disk to scan the subject and generate electrical signals. But unlike Baird, Takayanagi took the 
        important step of using a cathode ray tube to display the received signal, successfully reproducing the Katakana character イ in December 1926. 
        In 1928 his research took a further breakthrough, when he managed to reproduce an image of a person with a resolution of 40 lines at a 
        refresh rate of 14 frames per second. In the 1930s Takayanagi and his research team developed a fully electronic television system using 
        a revised version of the iconoscope. This was followed by the invention of a video receiver capable of reproducing images with a resolution 
        of 441 lines at 30 frames per second, the best on the market at the time.</p>
