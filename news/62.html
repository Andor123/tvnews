    <h1 class="h1">Television in Afghanistan</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television broadcasts in Afghanistan started in 1978 (Hijri Shamsi 1357). 
        As of 2017, there were around 76 local channels operating in the country; 
        the state television channel is Afghanistan National Television. 
        As with other mass media in Afghanistan, television is regulated by the Ministry of Information and Culture.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">The conceptual foundation of television in Afghanistan was first elucidated by Dr. Hafiz Sahar, 
        chief editor of the Eslah national daily newspaper, in his 1967 investigative academic work at New York University. 
        He made a compelling argument and advocated, based on other developing countries experiences, 
        the need for television as an educational tool as well as practical solutions to initial technical 
        problems of bringing television in Afghanistan, such as “Kabul itself is dominated by two high hills 
        that make excellent natural broadcasting towers, thus, simplifying coverage problems”.</p>
    <p class="lead">Technical and financial aid provided by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) 
        kickstarted the construction work of the studio and transmitter buildings in 1976, 
        with the work completed by August 1978. The state-owned Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA, previously just Radio Afghanistan) 
        launched the first TV channel in Afghanistan at first broadcasting for two hours daily starting in August 1978. 
        During the 1980s, many Soviet programs were airing such as the children's show Nu Pogodi!. 
        The studios of RTA were also often used by musicians to record music videos.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Television ownership and viewership</h2>
    <p class="lead">According to a market research survey conducted by the Afghan Wireless Communication Company in 2023,
         with over 7,100 randomly selected participants from various regions of Afghanistan, 
         Ariana Television Network (and its news channel Ariana News) is the most-watched television channel 
         in Afghanistan followed by TOLO TV (and its news channel TOLOnews), Shamshad TV, and Lemar TV.</p>
