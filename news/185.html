    <h1 class="h1">Television in Cuba</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Cuba was the first Latin American country to begin television testing in December 1946 when 
        station CM-21P conducted an experimental multi-point live broadcast. The first regular commercial broadcasting began in October 1950 
        by the small radio station Union Radio, soon followed by other stations. The broadcasts featured sport, soap operas, news, cooking shows, and comedy. 
        Censorship was imposed following the 1952 coup by Fulgencio Batista, and again by the government of the Cuban revolution after their victory in 1959.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">Commercial television arrived in Cuba on October 25, 1950, the first in the Caribbean and second in Latin America. 
        In the 1940s, Cuba's two largest radio stations, CMQ (which had begun testing in 1946) and RHC-Cadena Azul, 
        announced they would soon start broadcasting television. Since building TV stations and broadcast networks from scratch 
        was extremely expensive and complex, it took longer than expected.</p>
    <p class="lead">They were both beaten to the air by the tiny radio station, Union Radio. Gaspar Pumarejo, owner of Union Radio, 
        built the new station in the Havana home and garage of a family named Mestre. Pumarejo set the inauguration of his TV station for October 24, 1950, 
        which was Journalists Day in Cuba. After honoring the journalist, Cuba's President Carlos Prío Socarrás was shown mugging 
        it up for the camera and playing the role of cameraman. After this event Union Radio's slogan became 
        Union Radio, primera en televisión, primera en popularidad ("Union Radio, first in television, first in popularity"). 
        Union Radio was quickly followed by CMQ Television, which officially launched with its first broadcasts on December 18, 1950.</p>
    <p class="lead">Soap operas ("telenovelas"), news, cooking shows, comedy shows and musical variety were shown. 
        After Union Radio TV went on the air, Cuban demand for television sets soared. Luckily Cuban broadcasting coincided 
        with a glut of sets in the US market. Despite the high cost, ranging $350 for a 16" set to $2,000 for a 30" set, 
        the Cuban government's Imports and Exports Analysis Agency estimated that Cubans had imported more than 100,000 television receivers by 1952.</p>
    <p class="lead">From its inception, Cuban television played a huge part in the social and political fiber of Cuban life. 
        Extensive discussions about television began to unfold in the radio and entertainment sections of Cuban newspapers and 
        magazines in the year leading up to October 14, 1950, the day Union Radio TV became the first television station to broadcast in Havana. 
        Critics believed that US television set a level of excellence that they wanted to uphold. 
        They believed the medium's primary purpose in Cuba would be to enhance the "high culture" education of the Cuban citizen.</p>
