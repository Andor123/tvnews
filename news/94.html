    <h1 class="h1">Television in Singapore</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television broadcasting in Singapore began on February 15, 1963. The public broadcaster, Mediacorp, 
        owned by the Singaporean government investment company Temasek Holdings, currently holds a monopoly on 
        terrestrial television channels in the country. In addition, Pay-TV services are available from 
        private operators such as StarHub TV and Singtel TV. Historically, the private ownership of satellite dishes was prohibited.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">The introduction of television in Singapore began with experimental closed-circuit broadcasts 
        during the British Radio Exhibition in August 1952, organized by the British Radio and Accessories Manufacturing Association (BRAMA). 
        British electronics company Pye supplied the equipment and set up a temporary studio, with Governor J. F. Nicoll delivering 
        the first televised speech. The exhibition attracted significant public attention, 
        reaching an estimated 400,000 viewers â€” around 40% of Singapore's population at the time.</p>
    <p class="lead">Although the Singaporean population had become aware of television technology, 
        the government opposed a privately operated television service, favouring public ownership. 
        An initial proposal in late 1952 estimated the initial cost of a state-run service, 
        which would be funded through license fees, at around $1 million. Although private companies such as Cathay Organization, 
        Shaw Brothers, and Rediffusion submitted bids to operate a commercial station, all were rejected.</p>
    <p class="lead">On January 3, 1963, the Singaporean government announced the start of pilot programming would begin on February 15. 
        The station was set to broadcast on VHF channel 5 in the 625-line television standard and would charge 
        a license fee of $24 per year ($2 per month), described at the time as being "one of the cheapest in this part of the world." 
        The output from the start of the pilot service was originally planned to last less than two hours before being extended to four hours by April. 
        A second channel was slated to start between August and September of the same year. By the time of the March extension, 
        the service was going to carry filmed programming in English and Hokkien, before gradually extending to include 
        Mandarin, Malay, Tamil, and other Chinese dialects. By April, the regular service would provide a four-hour schedule 
        in every one of the official languages of Singapore. A temporary studio was constructed on Caldecott Hill in 
        the precincts of Radio Singapore, and a television transmitter was erected at Bukit Batok. The staff consisted of experienced workers 
        coming from the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan. Ahead of the start of the pilot service, manufacturers of television 
        sets were advised to ensure that their presets would match channels 5 and 8.</p>
