    <h1 class="h1">Television in Vietnam</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Vietnam began to appear in the mid-1960s in Saigon, 
        then under control of South Vietnam, with the appearance of Saigon Television Station. 
        In 1970, in the North, the Voice of Vietnam broadcast the first experimental television program. 
        Beginning from the late 1970s, color television was introduced and broadcast experimentally. 
        Today, television in Vietnam is available in many broadcasting formats, with many national and local channels, 
        broadcast or pay-per-view with more than 200 channels available to viewers. 
        Vietnam completed the digital television transition in 21 provinces starting on 30 June 2020 
        and throughout the whole country on 28 December, shutting down all analog signals in the country.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">Television was first introduced in October 1959 in the Republic of Vietnam during an exhibition in Saigon. 
        In this pilot program, the artists sat in the military microphone studio, and the audience watched through 
        two screens located in the exhibition center from 19:30 to 20:30 every day. The weekly newspaper Điện ảnh (Cinema) 
        published in November 1959 said: "Once a television station is established, we believe that there will be a 
        lot of people buying televisions so that they can keep up with the television broadcast programs."</p>
    <p class="lead">While the television coverage of the United States and the Saigon Government 
        in the South is increasing day after day, television has not appeared in the North at all. 
        According to journalist Hoàng Tùng, former Editor-in-Chief of the Nhân Dân (People) newspaper, 
        Head of the Central Propaganda Department, in the 1960s, every time he went on a business trip abroad, 
        he used to watch TV in other countries, President Ho Chi Minh often reminded cadres to prepare all conditions 
        to build the television industry. Implementing that idea, the Vietnam Television Film Studio was established 
        in January 1968, under the General Department of Information, with the task of producing 16-millimetre 
        television films for foreign television stations, mainly about the Vietnam War, 
        and at the same time prepare to build a television industry.</p>
    <p class="lead">In the South, after the Paris Peace Accords came into force, all AFVN stations officially 
        ceased to operate and all machinery and equipment were handed over to THVN9. The network of THVN9 has therefore, 
        expanded to the whole Republic of Vietnam. The station ceased its operations on the night of 29 April 1975, 
        the day before the Fall of Saigon. After Saigon was captured, Voice of Vietnam and the Liberation Station A, 
        together with Liberation Station B in the Southeast region took over the entire radio and television system left by the old regime. 
        Saigon Television Station was renamed Liberation Television Station and began airing again on the evening of 1 May 1975. 
        At the same time, Đắc Lộ Television became the second campus of the Liberation Television Station and resumed operation on 3 October 1975. 
        Until 2 July 1976, Saigon was officially renamed as Ho Chi Minh City, Liberation Television Station 
        was renamed to Ho Chi Minh City Television (abbreviated HTV).</p>
    <p class="lead">In the North, in 1976, the Television Center was built in Giảng Võ, Hanoi, and from here, 
        television began to be broadcast daily along with the construction of a television tower at Pole 1200 in Tam Dao. 
        In 1977, the Television Editorial Board separated from the Voice of Vietnam, 
        becoming the new Central Television Station (THTW) and moved its headquarters to the new Center.</p>
