    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Tajikistan began in the late 1950s, 
        when the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic still existed as constituent republic of the Soviet Union. 
        The television system of Tajikistan, like other countries of the former USSR, is done using SECAM standard. 
        In 1932, the Committee for Radiofication and Broadcasting under the 
        Council of People's Commissars of the Tajik SSR was created, 
        changing its name few times and known since 1978 as the 
        State Committee of the Tajik SSR on Television and Radio Broadcasting, 
        which launched the Tajik Radio station.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">The building of the Dushanbe television center was built on the site 
        of the former botanical garden on Kuibyshev Street (now Bekhzod, 7 "a") on an area of 4 hectares. 
        The first and most famous announcers of Tajik television 
        are Rafoat Abdusalomova, Alexandra Leonova and Georgiy Mazurovsky.</p>
    <p class="lead">The broadcasting of Stalinabad Television began on 3rd of October 1959 
        with announcer who began the first issue of "Akhbor" in the Tajik language announcing: 
        "Asallomu aleikum, dear viewers! The Stalinabad television studio begins its first broadcasts!".</p>
    <p class="lead">In 1996, the State Television and Radio Broadcasting Service of the Republic of Tajikistan 
        was divided into Tajik Television and Tajik Radio. 
        On September 3, 2005, instead of Shabakai 2, the TV channel Safina was launched, 
        later transferred to a separate state institution, in 2006 the state television company TV Bahoriston was created. 
        In 2008, the information and public television channel Jahonnamo began broadcasting, 
        Sughd, Kulyab, Khatlon and Gorno-Badakhshan television were transferred to separate frequencies. 
        Since March 1, 2016, two new television channels began broadcasting - Varzish TV and Sinamo, 
        in early 2017 the Football TV channel, and in November of the same year the Shakhnavoz TV channel began broadcasting.</p>
