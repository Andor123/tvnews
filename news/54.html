    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Kyrgyzstan was introduced in 1958, when Kyrgyzstan was still known 
        as the Kirghiz SSR. KTR launched that year and broadcast in Russian language.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">The Kyrgyz SSR started its own television broadcasts in December 1958, 
        after the completion of construction for a television twoer and studio 
        at the Drezhensky street in Frunze (the current Bishkek). 
        Construction work on the 196 meter tower began in 1956 and after its conclusion it became 
        one of the tallest buildings of the city. In its initial phase, Kyrgyz Television broadcast 
        four hours a week. The emergence and development of television in the Kyrgyz SSR was facilitated 
        by television directors J. Moldobaev, D. Varivada, T. Uraliev, editors Sh Smatov, D. Abramova, 
        A. Cheremushkina, M. Ronkin, camera operators G. Kim, A. .Kim, announcers S. Zhunushalieva, 
        T. Bakieva (Dzhamanbaeva), L. Tulmenko, R. Ryskeldinova and G. Subbotin.</p>
    <p class="lead">The first president of the Radio and Television Committee, Rabiya Menseyitova, 
        in one of the internal documents in 1960, appointed the lack of qualified personnel for 
        television broadcasts and the lack of feedback from viewers. A key component of broadcasts 
        in the 1960s was the topic of agriculture. Development of the topic was facilitated by 
        the creation of a separate team led by K. Chukuldukov.</p>
