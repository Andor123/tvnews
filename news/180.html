    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Ecuador is most important among the country's mass media. Television programming is dominated by telenovelas, series, and news programming. 
        Private and government-run channels coexist at the national, regional, and local levels. Cable channels are also beginning to appear, 
        most of which are exclusive to the companies that operate them. Finally, there are also internet television channels, 
        some of which have specific themes like LGBT programming.</p>
    <p class="lead">There are six private channels (Ecuavisa, Teleamazonas, RTS, Telerama, RTU, Radio y Televisión Unidas, Latele and Oromar Televisión) 
        and four government-run channels (TC Televisión, Gama TV, Canal Uno and Ecuador TV) available throughout the country. 
        In 2011, 83% of channels were privately owned, 17% were publicly owned, and 0% were community owned.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">Television in Ecuador started by initiative of José Rosenbaum, a German Jew who fled to Ecuador to escape persecution by Nazi Germany. 
        Together with his wife, Linda Zambrano, from Manabí, they travelled to a fair in Hanover to buy equipment for the first television station. 
        The station was initially set to be in Quito, but due to lack of public awareness, the station moved to Guayaquil. 
        The first test broadcasts were conducted on September 29, 1959 in the facilities of Radio Cenit.</p>
    <p class="lead">In the same year, regular television broadcasts of HCJB-TV, owned by the HCJB radio ministry, began in Quito. 
        Its launch was marked by a lack of television regulations, which were officially imposed on December 5, 1959. 
        Rosenbaum's station, Primera Televisora Ecuatoriana, started broadcasting on December 12, 1960. 
        Owned by Organizaciones Norlop, it was later renamed Telecuador, during which it started (in 1962) 
        the first fully-commercial television station in Quito (channel 6) in 1962.</p>
