    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">The idea of a national Monégasque public channel emerged 
        in the principality in 2021, with the aim of recovering Monaco's international communications, 
        after RMC moved to Paris in 2002 and the 100% acquisition of TMC by the TF1 Group in June 2016.</p>
    <p class="lead">Initially named Monte-Carlo Riviera TV, 
        it was originally planned to launch in late 2022, however, 
        it was delayed to the third quarter of 2023. On 23 March 2023, 
        a new name and launch date were announced for the channel. 
        The channel was renamed TVMonaco and officially launched on 1 September 2023. 
        In December 2021, MCR/TVMonaco joined TV5Monde. The name TVMonaco was announced in March 2023.</p>
    <p class="lead">The channel announced on social media on 17 August 2023 
        that the first broadcast would be on 1 September 2023 at 19:15. 
        The opening broadcast saw the presence of Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene. 
        Each public television company part of TV5Monde, as well as France 24, helped build the channel:</p>
    <p class="lead">technical support was given from RTBF;</p>
    <p class="lead">governance was built with RTS;</p>
    <p class="lead">while Radio-Canada and TV5 Monde provided support regarding its content.</p>
    <p class="lead">On 18 December 2024, the announcement of the merger of TVMonaco and Monaco Info was made public, 
        being replaced by a new, "independent" channel from 1 September 2025. 
        Geneviève Berti will become the "prefigurer" of the new channel.</p>
