    <h1 class="h1">Television in Madagascar</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television Malagasy (TVM) has an extensive national network reach; privately owned TV broadcasters in cities and major towns; 
        relays of 2 international broadcasters are available in Antananarivo (2007).</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Media restrictions</h2>
    <p class="lead">Although the law provides for freedom of speech, authorities severely restrict freedom of speech 
        by intimidating opponents and resorting to imprisonment or violence when threats fail to dissuade critics. 
        The de facto minister of communications targeted those who expressed dissent, sending official warning letters to 
        news outlets whose coverage displeased the regime. From 2010 through 2012 an estimated 80 radio and television station licenses 
        withdrawn and the stations ordered suspend broadcasting immediately. By the end of 2012 they had not been authorized to reopen. 
        In September 2012 the editor of the national television station was suspended, reportedly for having opposition politicians on the air. 
        Authorities also suspend journalists who continue to broadcast despite government warnings. To maintain access to sources and remain safe, 
        journalists widely practiced self-censorship.</p>
    <p class="lead">On 2 May 2012, authorities imprisoned the editors of the private radio station Free FM, 
        Lalatiana Rakotondrazafy and Fidel Razara Pierre, for a two-day investigation following a libel suit brought by Mamy Ravatomanga, 
        a well-known backer of the de facto regime. Following a series of public rallies that same month marking the first anniversary of 
        Free FM and calling for greater press freedom, the radio's editors were charged with provoking outrage against the regime, 
        destruction of public goods, mounting opposition to security forces, and holding a public demonstration without authorization. 
        On 22 July 2012, authorities closed the radio station, and the two journalists and another colleague went into hiding. 
        By the end of 2012 Free FM remained closed. But after a deal consented with the two journalists and the regime, 
        initiated by Mamy Ravatomanga, Lalatiana Rakotondrazafy is free and become the allied of the Rajoelina's regime.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Shortwave relay stations</h2>
    <p class="lead">In 2013, the government of Madagascar and Malagasy Global Business S.A. signed an agreement to operate the Madagascar relay station in Talata-Volonondry. 
        Among its customers are Radio Netherlands Worldwide, NHK World-Japan, BBC World Service, Deutsche Welle, Vatican Radio, Adventist World Radio and Free Press Unlimited.</p>
