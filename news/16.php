    <p class="lead">Television in Cyprus was introduced in 1956.
        Private TV was introduced on 26 April 1992, by Logos TV which started
        its transmissions in STEREO and TELETEXT from day one.
        The first private TV station of Cyprus was owned and operated by
        the Church of Cyprus. In August, 1995, the same station
        introduced the first ISP in Cyprus, LOGOSNET. The Republic of Cyprus
        currently uses the PAL colour system, and has converted terrestrial
        transmissions to digital on 1 July 2011, in line with EU policy.
        Because of the political division of the island,
        television companies are also divided.</p>
    <p class="lead">Terrestrial digital transmission is now available in Cyprus
        (parallel analogue transmissions ended finally on 1 July 2011).
        Satellite digital transmission is available through the NOVA Cyprus platform.
        Athina Sat, another provider, was launched in May 2005 but ceased operations
        in 2008. CytaVision and PrimeTel both offer digital TV through IPTV transmission
        and Cablenet through its privately owned cable network (in certain urban areas).</p>
