    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television is one of the major mass media of Argentina. As of 2019, household ownership of television sets in the country is 99%, 
        with the majority of households usually having two sets. Cable television has become the most used type of delivering, 
        with 73.2% of households having a cable provider.</p>
    <p class="lead">Argentine television broadcasting officially began on October 17, 1951, with the inaugural of the state-owned Canal 7 (now Televisión Pública). 
        It remains as the network with the biggest national coverage, while private broadcasting networks have a big number of affiliates 
        in different cities through all the country. Argentina also became the fourth most important country in terms of export of television formats, 
        only surpassed by the United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="lead">Argentina's broadcast television system includes PAL-N for analog television and ISDB-T for digital television. 
        Half of television sets in Argentina remained with analog services in 2017, although the analogue shutdown is expected to take place before 30 June 2025.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">The first license for a television network in Argentina was given to Martín Tow in 1945, but only experimental. 
        Argentina's first television broadcast occurred on October 17, 1951, with the inaugural of then state-owned Canal 7, 
        developed by Radio Belgrano executive Jaime Yankelevich. The broadcast began with a transmission of the last public act 
        of Eva Perón alongside Juan Perón on the Loyalty Day at 14:20 p.m.</p>
    <p class="lead">The first Argentine production was the newscast Primer Telenoticioso Argentino that premiered on April 20, 1954 on Canal 7. 
        Other important shows of the time were cooking show Jueves Hogareños with famous cookbook author and television chef Doña Petrona, 
        the first telenovelas under Teleteatro de la Tarde and later Teleteatro para la Hora del Té, humorous show Tato y sus Monólogos by Tato Bores, 
        and American sports show Gillette Cavalcade of Sports.</p>
    <p class="lead">On November 25, 1957, the decree-law 15460/57 was approved, 
        which established the granting of licenses, leading to the birth of private television.</p>
