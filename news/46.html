    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Created in 1983 by Pope John Paul II, Vatican Media has 
        been legally associated with Vatican City since November 1996. 
        Its main goal is the universal expansion of Catholicism by 
        creating television content and broadcasting images of the pope and of Vatican activities.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Programs</h2>
    <p class="lead">Programs are mainly based on what happens in the Vatican. 
        Daily prayers such as Angelus, general audiences on Wednesdays, 
        and various celebrations are broadcast. The pope's travels around the world are also broadcast. 
        Each year, it broadcasts around 130 events in the Vatican and 
        covers daily public activities of the pope, as well as his main activities outside the Vatican.</p>
    <p class="lead">Octava Dies is a weekly magazine of 25 minutes, 
        broadcast in the entire world since Easter 1998. 
        It is also broadcast by Italian Catholic television channels 
        and by press agencies such as APTN. It is available 
        in English and Italian on the Vatican's website 
        (broadcast every Sunday at 12:30 after the Angelus).</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Production</h2>
    <p class="lead">Vatican Media produced many documentaries during the reigns of 
        Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. It made documentaries on the lives of the popes, 
        on the Vatican City, and on the main churches of Catholicism. 
        They were mainly broadcast in Italian but also in English, Spanish, French and other languages.</p>
