    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in the Republic of Ireland is available
        through a variety of platforms. The digital terrestrial television
        service is known as Saorview and is the primary source of broadcast
        television since analogue transmissions ended on 24 October 2012.
        Digital satellite (from Sky Ireland, Saorsat and other European
        satellite service providers are available) and Cable
        (from Virgin Media Ireland) are also widely used.</p>
    <p class="lead">The Irish satellite fill-in service (Saorsat) is via
        Ka-Sat using the Irish Ka band spot and has been
        available since June 2011.</p>
    <p class="lead">While many people receive their television via Saorview,
        which is broadcast by 2RN, more than half subscribe to multichannel
        television networks. The biggest single multichannel television
        network in Ireland is Sky Ireland, which broadcasts digital satellite
        television services. Virgin Media Ireland, Magnet Networks, Eir and
        Smart Vision, among others, provide similar digital television
        services to Irish viewers.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Regulation</h2>
    <p class="lead">In Ireland, the Commission for Communications Regulation
        regulates radio wave spectrum licensing, and since 1 October 2009
        the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland regulates both public service
        broadcasters such as RTÃ‰, TG4 and commercial broadcasters.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Cable</h2>
    <p class="lead">Prior to Sky Digital, cable television was the most
        common system for distributing multi-channel television in Ireland.
        With more than 40 years of history and extensive networks of both
        wired and "wireless" cable, Ireland is amongst the most cabled
        countries in Europe. Forty percent[42] of Irish homes received
        cable television in September 2006. The figure dropped slightly
        in the early years of the 21st century due to the increased popularity
        of satellite reception, notably Sky, but has stabilised recently.</p>
    <p class="lead">In Ireland, Virgin Media Ireland, which formerly traded
        under the brand names Chorus NTL and UPC Ireland, is by far the largest
        cable and MMDS operator, owning all of the state's MMDS licences
        and almost all of the state's cable TV operators. Virgin Media
        offers analogue and digital cable television services in cities
        and towns throughout the country (with the exception of Cork,
        where the network is digital-only). It offers MMDS services in
        rural areas. Other than Virgin Media, the only other operators
        providing analogue and digital cable systems are Crossan CableComm
        which operates in Longford, Smyths Cablevision, which operates
        in Cavan, and Casey Cablevision which operates in Dungarvan,
        County Waterford.</p>
