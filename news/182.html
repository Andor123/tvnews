    <h1 class="h1">Television in Colombia</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Colombia or Colombian television (Spanish: Televisión de Colombia) is a media of Colombia. 
        It is characterized for broadcasting telenovelas, series, game shows and TV news. 
        Until 1998 it was a state monopoly (though there was a short-lived local private channel from 1966 to 1971, known as Teletigre). 
        There are two privately owned TV networks and three state-owned TV networks with national coverage, 
        as well as six regional TV networks and dozens of local TV stations. There are numerous cable TV companies operating 
        in Colombia under each Colombian department statutes. These cable companies also develop their own channels, 
        in addition to a variety of international channels. Television in Colombia has always relied on technological advancements 
        from developed countries importing almost all the equipment.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">Television in Colombia was inaugurated on 13 June 1954 during the government of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, 
        who became impressed with the new invention during a visit to Nazi Germany as a military attaché. Rojas imported Siemens and DuMont equipment 
        and hired Cuban technicians to set up a TV station in time for the commemoration of Rojas's first year in office. 
        A test broadcast was made 1 May 1954 covering Bogotá and Manizales.</p>
    <p class="lead">Initially television in Colombia was public, with emphasis on education and cultural topics until, 
        in 1955, the government developed a system of concessions, in which the State was in charge of the television infrastructure and gave programming 
        slots in the channels to private companies known as programadoras. These companies bid for timeslots on the national channel to show their programs. 
        The first of these companies to be founded was Producciones PUNCH, followed quickly by RTI Colombia. 
        In 1963 Inravisión, the public broadcaster, was created. Before that, it was operated by the Televisora Nacional, 
        part of the Radiodifusora Nacional de Colombia. In 1966 the government then tried to privatize the sector, opening bidding for a private license in Bogotá. 
        Caracol, RTI and Punch would bid on the license, but the winner was Consuelo Salgar de Montejo and her Teletigre. 
        Teletigre was a huge success. Mrs. Montejo made an alliance with ABC and brought many of the US shows translated into Spanish to the local viewers. 
        The government did not renew the broadcast license for Teletigre. Teletigre, which would return to state hands and become Tele 9 Corazón and, 
        in 1972 Segunda Cadena, with national coverage. Mrs. Montejo attempted on many occasions to get back in broadcasting TV, but the government refused to give her slots.</p>
    <p class="lead">On 1 December 1979, regular color television broadcasts started in Colombia using the NTSC standard. 
        Color television had already been introduced in October 1973, when programadora Cenpro Televisión made a color broadcast 
        during an education seminar with Japanese-made equipment. The inauguration and the first match of the 1974 FIFA World Cup 
        were broadcast live in color, but they could be seen in color only on big screens in Bogotá and Cali.</p>
