    <p class="lead">San Marino RTV was founded in August 1991 thanks to a 
        share capital of Ente per la Radiodiffusione Sammarinese (ERAS, San Marino Broadcasting Company) 
        and the Italian public service broadcaster, RAI. 
        Both participated with 50% of the capital. The agreement 
        between both parties is subject to periodic reviews to 
        guarantee and update the public service broadcasting objectives. 
        San Marino RTV broadcasts in Italian, the official language of San Marino.</p>
    <p class="lead">Experimental radio broadcasts began on 27 December 1992. 
        On 28 February 1993, Radio San Marino was launched broadcasting 24 hours a day. 
        Experimental television broadcasts began on 24 April 1993.
