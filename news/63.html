    <h1 class="h1">Television in Saudi Arabia</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Saudi Arabia was introduced in 1965, but is now dominated by just five major companies: 
        Middle East Broadcasting Center, SM Enterprise TV, Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, Rotana and Saudi TV. 
        Together, they control 80% of the pan-Arab broadcasting market. 
        Saudi Arabia is a major market for pan-Arab satellite and pay-TV. Saudi investors are behind the major networks MBC, 
        which is based in Dubai, and Emirates based OSN. The Saudi government estimated that in 2000 the average 
        Saudi spent 50% to 100% more time watching television than his or her European or US counterpart. 
        On average, 2.7 hours are spent daily watching TV in Saudi Arabia.</p>
    <p class="lead">The pay-TV market in Saudi Arabia is big, with a penetration estimated at 21%. 
        beIN Sports is one of the largest pay-TV players in terms of subscriptions, with a market share of 59%.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">The first television broadcasts in Saudi Arabia originated from a 200-watt television station, 
        AJL-TV, "The Eye of the Desert". These were English-language programs for the personnel of the USAF Dhahran Airfield, 
        and started on 17 June 1955. The programming was from contemporary American television, but all references to Christianity, 
        Israel or alcohol were edited out. In September 1957, ARAMCO began a television service for 
        its 9,000 employees in Dhahran; that service would cease operations on 31 December 1998. 
        The first state owned television channel Al Saudiya would launch on 7 July 1965.</p>
    <p class="lead">Nawal Baksh was the first Saudi woman to appear on Saudi television, in 1966.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">State-managed stations</h2>
    <p class="lead">The terrestrial broadcast sector in Saudi Arabia is state-owned through the Ministry of Media. 
        The state-run Broadcasting Services of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia operates almost all domestic broadcasting outlets. 
        State-run television consists of four channels: Saudi One, the main channel in Arabic launched in 1963; 
        Saudi Two, an English language channel; Al Riyadiah, a sports channel; and the news channel Al Ekhbariya.</p>
    <p class="lead">Government-owned terrestrial television has changed little since 1969. 
        Its programming is still predominantly focused on educational, entertainment, and religious subjects. 
        Reruns of Arabic-language cinema, particularly Egyptian movies, are also broadcast. 
        Political content other than official government announcements has remained relatively limited.</p>
