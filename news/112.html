    <h1 class="h1">Television in Sudan</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Sudan has a low penetration of around 17%, as many households cannot afford the cost of a satellite dish, 
        and terrestrial television is the dominant platform. There are no private terrestrial television stations, 
        and the government operates Sudanese Radio and Television Corporation.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History and present</h2>
    <p class="lead">Sudan officially began television transmission in 1963. In the early years, it only reached a short distance from Khartoum.</p>
    <p class="lead">Sudan has 18 terrestrial channels, just one of which, Blue Nile TV, is not wholly state-owned. 
        Sudan TV is the main terrestrial channel. There are eight free-to-air direct-to-home channels headquartered in Sudan, 
        of which five are privately owned, two are government owned and one has mixed ownership. Pay-TV penetration is negligible in the country.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">Censorship</h3>
    <p class="lead">Sudan TV stations are restricted by a military censor to ensure that the news do not contradict official views and perceived cultural values. 
        Satellite dishes are common in affluent areas and pan-Arab television stations are popular. 
        In addition to domestic and satellite TV services, there was a subscription cable network, 
        which directly rebroadcast uncensored foreign news and other programs.</p>
    <p class="lead">The government shut down the Al-Jazeera bureau late in 2003 and arrested the bureau chief 
        for alleged false programming and poor analysis of atrocities in Darfur. 
        The bureau chief went to prison, but Al-Jazeera subsequently reopened the office.</p>
