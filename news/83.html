    <h1 class="h1">Television in Hong Kong</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Hong Kong is primarily in Cantonese and English. It is delivered through 
        analogue and digital terrestrial, cable, IPTV, and the Internet. Satellite TV is not common, 
        although many housing estates have dishes and re-distribute a limited number of free channels 
        through coaxial cables. The dominant broadcaster is TVB, ViuTV and HOY TV.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">Hong Kong's television history began with the launch of Rediffusion Television (RTV) 
        on 29 May 1957 (later renamed as Asia Television (ATV)). RTV started off as a cable subscription service but became 
        a free-to-air broadcaster in 1973, with Cantonese and English channels. In April 2016, the Executive Council decided 
        not to renew ATV's broadcast licence and its channels closed.</p>
    <p class="lead">Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) was the territory's first free-to-air commercial station (launching in 1967) 
        and remains the predominant TV broadcaster today with multiple Cantonese channels and one English channel, on analogue and digital.</p>
    <p class="lead">There was also an Internet television and VOD channel called Hong Kong Technology Venture 
        (HKTV, owned by the City Telecom, which was renamed as the same name in 2013) which was launched in 2014 and 
        can be viewed on smart TVs, set-top boxes, personal computers, smartphones, and tablet computers, then closed in 2018. 
        And ATV was revived as the OTT platform in 2017 and is still running today.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Digital terrestrial television</h2>
    <p class="lead">Hong Kong was not required to follow China's DTT standard, but the Hong Kong government nevertheless 
        opted to use DMB-T/H (now known as DTMB) as the digital terrestrial television broadcast standard in 2004 
        (hence rejecting the DVB-T standard originally proposed in 1998 and trialled in 2000). The official start of 
        DTT broadcasting was at 7pm on 31 December 2007 as the first digital TV signal transmitter in Tsz Wan Shan went online.</p>
    <p class="lead">Starting 1 December 2021, six digital television channels (being TVB Jade, ViuTVsix, ViuTV, RTHK TV 31, RTHK TV 32 and RTHK TV 33) 
        will transit from frequencies in the 600/700 MHz bands to the 500 MHz band to support and boost telecommunication services 
        for applications like 5G networks as well as improving network coverage. A six-month transition stage from 1 April will 
        simulcast TV channels on both existing and new frequencies to smoothen the transition.</p>
