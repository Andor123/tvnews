    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Morocco. Terrestrial television viewing was estimated at 20% of total television households in 2011. 
        IPTV is offered by Maroc Telecom. Digital terrestrial television is gradually spreading, with 41 national and foreign channels. 
        The national broadcaster SNRT aimed to complete digital switchover by 2015.</p>
    <p class="lead">Morocco has nine domestic free-to-air channels: seven government-owned, one privately owned, and one of mixed ownership. 
        2M TV started out in 1989 as the first private terrestrial channel in Morocco, however it later became a mixed ownership channel 
        as 70% of its capital was bought by the government. It is by far the most watched channel in Morocco, as cited by 84% of TV viewers. 
        Medi 1 TV (formerly Medi 1 Sat) is a privately owned channel, although 50% of its shares are owned by companies from the public sector. 
        The other seven channels are all government-owned.</p>
    <p class="lead">beIN SPORTS is the most popular pay-TV bouquet in Morocco, accounting for around 65% of the local pay-TV market.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">Morocco was a pioneer in television in the Arab world. In the 1950s, the country had a first experience undertaken by a French company, 
        known as TELMA, who saw in the European community in Morocco a potential audience. In 1951, the authorization of broadcasting was ceded to TELMA, 
        which did not begin to transmit until February 1954. The experiment was short-lived and the station ceased broadcasts soon after covering 
        the return of Sultan Mohammed V (later King) to Morocco on November 16, 1955. The cancellation was over political reasons generated by 
        the Moroccan nationalist movement, which ultimately deprived the company of advertising resources, local advertisers gradually withdrawing 
        their contracts for fear of possible reprisals, as reported in an interview with Abdellah Chakroun, former Director of Moroccan Television, 
        author of the book "Reflections on the Audiovisual and Theater".</p>
