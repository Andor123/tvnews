    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in North Korea is subject to the Korean Central Broadcasting Committee and controlled 
        by the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Workers' Party of Korea. 
        A study in 2017 found that 98% of households had a television set.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Technological data</h2>
    <p class="lead">Television in North Korea uses a PAL 576i Systems D and K analog signal transmission system and 4:3 aspect ratio. 
        Before 1993, North Korea was operating on the SECAM television system, which also uses 576i at 4:3. 
        The four major television channels — Korean Central Television, Mansudae, Athletic Television and Ryongnamsan — broadcast over the air, 
        as well as on a cable television system in Pyongyang; these channels are also available in a special app found 
        on the government issued Samjiyon tablet computers, as well as on the Manbang IPTV service.</p>
    <p class="lead">North Korea uses DVB-T2 for Digital Terrestrial Television. Trials began in 2012. 
        As of 2020, multiple set-top box models were available, giving access to the four broadcast channels.</p>
    <p class="lead">Television sets sold in North Korea are able to operate only on the PAL and DVB-T2 systems, 
        to prevent them from being able to pick up broadcasts from South Korea (which use NTSC System M analogue and ATSC digital) 
        or China (which uses DTMB digital). However, broadcasts from Russia can be picked up, as they are also DVB-T2. 
        Imported TV sets that are able to operate on both PAL and NTSC, such as those from Japan, 
        have their NTSC abilities disabled by the government on import.</p>
