    <p class="lead">Television stations in Slovakia broadcast in DVB-T format.
        Broadcasting is mostly in the Slovak language,
        state owned channels have some dedicated broadcasting for
        ethnic minorities (always subtitled).
        Foreign language (with the exception of Czech) movies and shows
        are dubbed (rarely subtitled). Czech production is mostly broadcast in original,
        with the exception of juvenile programs. Often, foreign language movies are broadcast
        with Czech dubbing. Czech television channels are also rather popular
        in Slovakia, received either directly in border regions or carried by cable companies.</p>
