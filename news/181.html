    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television was introduced to Costa Rica in 1960 with Teletica, the first experiments were conducted in October 1954, 
        by technician Álvaro Zamora Dobles and businessmen Manuel Mendiola y Álvaro Zúñiga. The scuccess of this experiment 
        led to the creation of Televisora Tica Limitada (Televitica), which in an initial phase only carried advertising slides for interested stores.</p>
    <p class="lead">In October 1958, a new agreement led to the creation of a new company, Televisora de Costa Rica, Teletica. 
        Its first regular broadcasts followed on May 9, 1960. New channels followed, starting with Tic-Tac Canal 9 on April 12, 1962, 
        Telecentro Canal 6 on September 12, 1965, Canal 2 Telenac on August 28, 1966 and Televictoria Canal 11 in 1969.</p>
    <p class="lead">Televictoria became the first television channel in Costa Rica to begin color broadcasts, which became regular in 1971 and full-time in 1974. 
        Public television started in 1978, with financing from the Spanish state.</p>
    <p class="lead">The 90s were marked by the creation of Representaciones Televisivas (Repretel) which was owned by Remigio Ángel González, 
        who, in 2008, would create a new umbrella brand for his networks, Albavisión. Starting with his acquisition of channel 9, he acquired channels 6 and 11 in 1995; 
        in 1997, Repretel 11 ended its relays of Repretel 6, gaining its own schedule. Mexican conglomerate TV Azteca acquired Canal 4 Multinoticias in 1998 
        with the aim of building a Latin American network of channels, but sold it to Repretel in early 2000 due to financial difficulties.</p>
    <p class="lead">Digital terrestrial television uses the ISDB-T standard in its Brazilian form; the last analog signals were switched off on January 31, 2023.</p>
