    <h1 class="h1">Television in Germany</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Germany began in Berlin on 22 March 1935,
        broadcasting for 90 minutes three times a week. It was the first public television
        station in the world, named Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow.
        The German television market had approximately 36.5 million television households
        in 2000, making it the largest television market in Europe.
        Nowadays, 95% of German households have at least one television receiver.
        All the main German TV channels are free-to-air.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Market</h2>
    <p class="lead">Today, with almost 40 million TV households,
        365 TV channels licensed in Germany and a total market volume
        of €9,615 million in 2008, Germany represents one of the biggest
        and most diversified TV markets in the world. The strongest revenue segment
        in Germany is public funding (€4,430 million in 2008),
        followed by advertising (€4,035 million) and subscription (1,150 € million).
        This dominant market position of public and advertisement funded free
        TV channels in Germany explains why the German pay TV segment
        is significantly underperforming in an international comparison.</p>
    <p class="lead">In terms of total TV viewing market share Germany's market
        leaders in 2017 were again the two biggest public-service broadcasters
        (ZDF with 13.0% and Das Erste with 11.3%) and the two leading commercial channels
        (RTL with 9.2% and SAT.1 with 6.7%). The leading pay TV provider was Sky Deutschland.
        The biggest teleshopping providers in Germany are QVC and HSE24.</p>
    <p class="lead">With 18.1 million TV households satellite
        is the dominant TV infrastructure in Germany, followed by cable
        (17.9 million TV households) and terrestrial (3.8 million TV households).
        In a 2010 survey half of German television viewers said they often
        found nothing to watch on television.</p>
    <p class="lead">The Germanophone sphere is the largest market for dubbing in Europe.
        Foreign TV shows and other formats are often dubbed into German,
        while subtitled formats with the original language are also becoming more popular.</p>
