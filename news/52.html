    <h1 class="h1">Television in Israel</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Israel refers to television broadcasting services in the State of Israel, 
        inaugurated on March 24, 1966. Initially, there was one state-owned channel, 
        operated jointly by the Israel Broadcasting Authority and the Israeli Educational Television. 
        In 1986, a second state-regulated channel was launched. 
        This channel became a state-regulated commercial channel in 1993. 
        An additional commercial channel was introduced in 2002, followed by the 
        introduction of three commercial niche channels: 
        an Israeli Russian-speaking channel (in 2002), a channel of Israeli popular music (in 2003) 
        and an Arabic-speaking channel (in 2012). Colour transmissions were introduced gradually 
        around 1977 and 1979. Multichannel cable television service became available to subscribers 
        gradually since 1989, although illegal cable TV stations were present in the big cities during the 1980s. 
        Satellite-based multichannel service has been available since 2000.</p>
    <p class="lead">Almost 75% of the population is subscribed to pay television systems which 
        are provided by the cable service provider Hot, or by the satellite service provider Yes. 
        The Israel Broadcasting Authority closed in May 2017 and was replaced by 
        the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation as the operator of the state-owned television channels. 
        Channel 2 split into two channels in November 2017, giving each of the two remaining commercial 
        companies their own channels, Keshet 12 and Reshet 13.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <h3 class="h2">Early years of statehood</h3>
    <p class="lead">Upon its establishment in May 1948, Israel had one radio station, 
        run directly by the government, which was a continuation of the British Mandate's Hebrew radio station. 
        The first governments, headed by David Ben-Gurion, did not favor the establishment of TV stations. 
        Nevertheless, the Israeli government discussed the idea of using television as an instructional 
        and educational tool in 1952 and 1955. In 1961 the Israeli government asked UNESCO to offer its opinion, 
        which was in favor of using television for educational purposes. 
        In the early 1960s, television broadcasts from neighboring Egypt, Lebanon, and Cyprus 
        gradually became available to Israelis through TV sets which were placed in public places, 
        like caf√©s. Since they were mainly in Arabic, these broadcasts were popular among Israeli Arabs. 
        This raised the government's concern about anti-Israel propaganda that might be included in them.</p>
    <h3 class="h2">Colour transmissions</h3>
    <p class="lead">Israeli television began operations when American and European stations were switching 
        to full-scale colour transmissions, but Israel's state-controlled stations broadcast only 
        in black and white. According to Arnon Zuckerman, head of IBA's television department from 1973 to March 1979, 
        Israeli prime minister Golda Meir described colour television as "artificial" and unnecessary. 
        Yair Lapid, son of Tommy Lapid, the IBA director general from April 1979 to March 1984, 
        claimed the IBA had the equipment for filming and broadcasting in colour for nearly 
        a decade before putting it into use, and the introduction of colour transmissions was halted due to political pressure.</p>
