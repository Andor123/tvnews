    <h1 class="h1">Television in China</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">The television industry in China includes high-tech program production, transmission and coverage. 
        China Central Television is China's largest state-run national television broadcaster. 
        By 1987, two-thirds of people in China had access to television. As of August 22, 2023, over 3,300 local, regional, 
        and national TV channels are available in the country.</p>
    <p class="lead">Chinese television drama has also gained popularity over the years, 
        garnering billions of views among China's most popular video websites, iQiyi, Youku, Tencent Video and Mango TV.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <h3 class="h3">Origins</h3>
    <p class="lead">When the People's Republic was founded in 1949, the telecommunications systems and facilities in China were outdated and rudimentary, 
        and many had been damaged or destroyed during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Communications in China were established rapidly 
        in the early 1950s. By 1952, the principal telecommunications network centered on Beijing, and links to all large cities had 
        finally been established, enabling the launch of television broadcasts. The first Chinese television station in the world was 
        Rediffusion Television (now ATV, off-air since 2016), which launched in Hong Kong on May 29, 1957. On the mainland, the first 
        national broadcasts began on May 1, 1958, and Beijing Television (now China Central Television since 1978) 
        was formally launched on September 2, 1958. A month later, the first regional station, Shanghai Television, 
        was launched on the 9th National Day, which was on October 1, 1958. Liaoning Television would begin a year later, and in 1960, 
        Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces had their stations begin full broadcasts.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">Today</h3>
    <p class="lead">Altogether, there are 3,000 television stations across the country. Large international TV expositions, 
        including the Shanghai Television Festival, Beijing International Television Week, China Radio and Television Exposition 
        and Sichuan Television Festival, are held on a regular basis.</p>
    <p class="lead">Besides judging and conferring awards, these festivals conduct academic exchanges and the import and export of TV programs. 
        Shanghai has become the largest television program trading market in Asia.</p>
    <p class="lead">In October 2014, actors and actresses who have used drugs, visited prostitutes, or broken the law were not 
        allowed to appear on television, movies, or other forms of broadcast (radio and advertisement) in China. The ban also encompassed online media, 
        film and publishing. China Daily reported that the ban is meant to "keep the industry healthy" and "Celebrities who break 
        the law should not be invited to appear in programs, and transmission of their words should be suspended." 
        It was also noted that "Recent cases involving stars using drugs or visiting prostitutes have harmed the image of the entertainment 
        industry and set a bad example for young people." In 2014, China detained several Chinese celebrities on drug-related charges. 
        The Ministry of Public Security stated in February 2014 that police need to "get tough on drugs, gambling, and prostitution."</p>
