        People who live in Switzerland and receive television services
        are required by law to pay a television licence fee, which is
        used to finance the public radio and television service SRG SSR.
        Licence fee-payers in all the linguistic regions of Switzerland all
        pay the same amount (462 CHF for 2008, counting both radio and television licences)
        and, in return, are entitled under the law to services of equal quality.</p>
