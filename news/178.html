    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Peru has a history of more than 60 years. There are 105 television broadcasters in Peru, 22 of which are in Lima. 
        In regard to television receivers, in 2003 there were 5,470,000 — that is 200 televisions for every thousand inhabitants. 
        The number of cable subscribers was 967,943 in 2011.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">The first experimental transmission of television in Peru occurred on September 21, 1939, 
        transmitting a film and an artistic program from Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe school in Lima. 
        Another test transmission was made by Antonio Pereyra from the Bolivar Hotel on May 28, 1954. 
        On January 17, 1958, the Ministry of Education and UNESCO inaugurated the State Channel 7 and conducted a test broadcast. 
        The first commercial television broadcast was on Channel 4 Radio América in Lima, on December 15, 1958, by Nicanor González and José Antonio Umbert. 
        Channel 4 Radio America's creation was possible because of an agreement with NBC and RCA.</p>
    <p class="lead">Several commercial television stations followed, including Channel 2 (Radiodifusora Victoria S.A.), 
        Channel 13 — later changed to Channel 5 (Panamericana Televisión S.A.), Channel 9 (Compañía Peruana de Producciones Radiales y TV), 
        Channel 11 (Bego Televisión S.A.). Many of them soon acquired — or were associated with — stations outside Metropolitan Lima. 
        In just two months, November and December 1959, Lima stores recorded sales of 10,000 television sets, 
        and full-page ads in newspapers and magazines announced the start of the era of television in Peru. By April 1960, 
        there were 55,000 television sets operating in the Peruvian capital. The growth of television in Peru was remarkably rapid. 
        In just two months, from November to December 1959, Lima stores sold 10,000 television sets, and full-page ads in newspapers 
        and magazines announced the start of the era of television in Peru. By April 1960, there were already 55,000 television sets 
        operating in the Peruvian capital, which was an explosive growth, considering that in 1958, there were only 5,000 televisions. 
        This demonstrates how quickly the technology was embraced and how it rapidly became an essential part of Peruvian life.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Digital television</h2>
    <p class="lead">On March 30, 2010, Peru starts digital television transition, with TV Perú being the first television station to begin broadcast digitally. 
        The analog broadcast in Peru will be discontinued in 2020.</p>
