    <h1 class="h1">Television in Iran</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television was first introduced to Iran in 1958, 
        as a privately-owned and commercially-operated enterprise, 
        before being nationalised, remaining a state-controlled monopoly, 
        first of National Iranian Radio and Television, and following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, 
        of Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting. Television, or more specifically IRIB, 
        is nicknamed "glass wool" by locals, because of the appearance of clerics with 
        long beards comparable to sheep wool, appearing behind the "glass", the television set.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">On October 3, 1958, Television Iran (TVI) was established, broadcasting from Tehran. 
        A second station, based in Abadan in the south of the country, was established in 1960. 
        Its programming included quiz shows and American programmes dubbed into Persian, 
        and appealed to an unsophisticated audience.</p>
    <p class="lead">Habib Sabet, a Baháʼí who was one of Iran's major industrialists, was the founder of the first television station. 
        The station manager was an American, A. Vance Hallack, who had previously operated the Baghdad Television Station in Iraq. 
        Before coming to the Middle East, Hallack had managed NBC's colour division.</p>
    <p class="lead">After the 1979 revolution, NIRT was renamed as
         صدا و سيمای جمهوری اسلامی ايران Seda va Sima-ye Jomhouri-e Eslami-ye Iran ("Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran"), 
         known in English as Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), and under the new Constitution of the Islamic Republic,
          radio and television were to be "aligned with the course of perfection of the Islamic Revolution and served 
          the promotion of Islamic culture, and to this end benefit from the healthy collision of different ideas and strictly 
          avoid spreading and propagating destructive and anti-Islamic tenets". A notable censorship episode happened in May 1995, 
          when one of its channels cut the feature film Running 70 minutes in with a black screen. 
          The broadcaster accused the censorship on "technical problems", but the real reason, 
          according to an observation made by the BBC, was the display of athletes wearing shorts and sleeveless tops.</p>
    <p class="lead">In 1998, Iran changed from using SECAM to the PAL system 
        developed in (Germany), and also used in the United Kingdom.</p>
