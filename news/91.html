    <h1 class="h1">Television in the Philippines</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in the Philippines was introduced in October 1953 with the 
        first commercial broadcast by Alto Broadcasting System (now ABS-CBN), making the Philippines 
        the first Southeast Asian country, and the second country in Asia, to broadcast. During the late 1940s, 
        Filipino engineers and students replicated academic experiments with broadcasting.</p>
    <p class="lead">From 1975 to 1978, the Sinag Awards were given by the Philippine Academy for Television Arts and Sciences (PATAS).</p>
    <p class="lead">Star Awards for Television, the country's oldest existing television awards, 
        are handed out annually by the Philippine Movie Press Club after being voted on by the press.</p>
    <p class="lead">The Philippines has no public broadcasting television network, but there are several government-owned networks.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <h3 class="h3">The early years</h3>
    <p class="lead">James Lindenberg, an American-born Filipino engineer dubbed the "father of Philippine television," 
        began assembling transmitters and established Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC) on July 11, 1946. 
        The company was named after his wife's hometown of Bolinao, Pangasinan. Three years later, he was the first to apply 
        for a license in the Philippine Congress to establish a television station. On June 14, 1950, his request was granted. 
        Due to the scarcity of raw materials and strict import control since 1948, he was compelled to branch into radio broadcasting instead.</p>
    <p class="lead">Lindenberg's attempt to establish a television station failed, though it would soon fall under new management. 
        Antonio Quirino, a judge and brother of then-president of the Philippines Elpidio Quirino, had been trying 
        to get a license from Congress that would allow him to set up a television station. Congress denied him from 
        getting such a license, primarily considered to result from fear that he might use it as a vehicle for propaganda for his brother, 
        who was then running for a second term in the presidential elections of 1953. As a result, Quirino bought a 70% share in BEC, 
        which indirectly granted him control of a television franchise. He changed the name of BEC to Alto Broadcasting System (ABS), 
        after the names of its new owners, Aleli and Judge Antonio Quirino. Lindenberg continued to serve as co-owner and general manager.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">Rising popularity</h3>
    <p class="lead">At the turn of the next decade, TV sets were in high demand in urban areas. Other VHF TV stations also opened around this period. 
        These include DZTV-TV (established on March 1, 1960, by Inter-Island Broadcasting Corporation (IBC), 
        owned by Dick Baldwin and later Andr√©s Soriano Sr. of San Miguel Corporation), DZBB-TV (established on October 29, 1961, 
        by Republic Broadcasting System (RBS), owned by Robert Stewart),[8] DZFM-TV (established in 1961 by the Philippine Broadcasting Service 
        of the Philippine government, now defunct),[9] DZRH-TV (established on April 11, 1962, by the Manila Broadcasting Company (MBC), 
        owned by Manuel "Manolo" Elizalde Sr.), DZTM-TV (established in July 1962, by Associated Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), 
        owned by Chino Roces, the publisher of The Manila Times),[10] DZFU-TV (established in August 1962, by FEATI University, now defunct), 
        and DZKB-TV (established on October 15, 1969, by Kanlaon Broadcasting System (KBS), owned by Roberto Benedicto). 
        Among the top-rated programs in the 1960s were The Nida-Nestor Show, Buhay Artista, and Pancho Loves Tita. 
        Another local show that has had a prevailing top rating is Tawag ng Tanghalan, the amateur singing contest hosted by Lopito and Patsy.</p>
