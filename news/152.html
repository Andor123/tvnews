    <h1 class="h1">Television in Zimbabwe</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Since the introduction of TV services in the country in the year 1960, there has only been 1 local free to air television channel, 
        which is owned by the government. In November 2020, the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe granted free to air, 
        national commercial TV broadcasting licences to 6 private companies after shortlisting 14 applicants, breaking the national broadcaster's 60 year old TV monopoly. 
        The regulator gave the 6 successful applicants 18 months to begin broadcasting.</p>
    <p class="lead">TV stations that were awarded licences include the Bulawayo based FairTalk Communications' KeYona TV, 
        ZimPapers Limited's ZTN (Zimpapers Television Network) (now known as ZTN Prime), Rusununguko Media's NRTV (Nkululeko Rusununguko Television), 
        Jester Media's 3K TV (now known as 3Ktv), Acacia Media Group's Kumba TV and Channel Dzimbahwe's Channel D. Unsuccessful applicants include AB Communications' Flex TV, 
        Alpha Media Holdings' HStv, Blackbury Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd's Blackbury TV, Conduit Investments (Pvt) Ltd's Conduit TV Station, Just in Time TV (Pvt) Ltd's JIT TV, 
        Medianet Productions (Pvt) Ltd's Sunrise TV and Meditation Investments (Pvt)'s Zim News Channel.</p>
    <p class="lead">Satellite stations are received in the country unrestricted, mainly through DStv, a digital satellite television and radio distributor. 
        Zimbabwe transmits analogue terrestrial television on the VHF band, with digital not yet deployed as of 2019. 
        Coverage in rural areas is low, due to poor infrastructure. Overall, 30% of the population receives broadcasts by the ZBC, 
        so radio is the main source of information. In 2006, a parliamentary committee in Zimbabwe called for an opening up of the broadcast media. 
        Chinese technology has been used to jam frequencies used by foreign based radio stations in South Africa, the US and the UK that criticise the government. 
        The vast majority of the media is practically propaganda, all of it either eulogises Mugabe, features pan-African programming, 
        and heavily spreads anti-British and anti-American sentiment on its TV and radio programming.</p>
    <p class="lead">There are 16 local radio stations, 6 of those are broadcasting nationally and the other 10 are provincial. 
        The public broadcaster owns 4 national and 2 regional radio stations. In 2012 two national private radio stations, Star FM and ZiFM Stereo were launched. 
        StarFM is owned by the government-controlled Zimpapers. It offers political discussion from a heavily pro-government perspective and 
        an expanded entertainment schedule. ZiFM, owned by ZANU–PF MP Supa Mandiwanzira is more focused on entertainment although it also offers political 
        and social opinion programmes that are heavily weighted towards pro-government positions. The two stations are seen as direct competition 
        to ZBC's youth orientated urban radio station, Power FM.</p>
    <p class="lead">In 2015, the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ) granted broadcasting licences to 8 regional radio stations 
        which included Bulawayo's Skyz Metro FM and Harare's Capitalk 100.4 FM, to mention a few. All the 8 radio stations were successfully operational 
        by the end of 2017 despite the tough economic challenges. In 2018, state owned ZBC further added 2 more regional radio stations, 
        Khulumani FM and 95.8 Central Radio in Bulawayo and Gweru respectively.</p>
    <p class="lead">In the presidential elections in 2008, the media gave significantly more coverage to the ruling party, ZANU–PF, 
        and rarely showed opposition broadcasts. It was also criticised for inciting violence against the opposition.</p>
