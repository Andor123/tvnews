    <h1 class="h1">Television in Thailand</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">In Thailand, television broadcasting started on 24 June 1955 (in NTSC). 
        Color telecasts (PAL, System B/G 625 lines) were started in 1967, and full-time color transmissions were launched in 1975. 
        As of November 2020, there are currently 21 digital (DVB-T2) TV channels in Thailand.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">Television was first officially introduced to Thailand on 24 June 1955 in NTSC. 
        One of the first broadcasters of television were the Mass Communication Organization of Thailand, 
        which was established on 10 November 1952. In the first few years, viewership was low before gradually 
        climbing to 2000 in 1957. Later on in 1955, the Radio Communications Act, B.E. 2498 was passed.</p>
    <p class="lead">Television had become the largest advertising medium in Thailand by 1959, with only two stations 
        in Bangkok serving 35,000 television sets in a population of nine million. As of 1967, Thailand had the third highest number 
        of television sets in Southeast Asia, with little more than 250,000 sets available. Color telecasts began in 1967, 
        and full-time color transmissions started in 1975.</p>
    <p class="lead">The introduction of digital terrestrial television quadrupled the number of available channels from six to 24, 
        but due to a lack of local content on some of the new entrants, overseas programs filled the void.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Analog terrestrial television</h2>
    <p class="lead">Currently, the traditional way of receiving television in Thailand is through 
        analog terrestrial television; however, it has now largely been supplanted by digital providers. 
        There are 6 channels; three of them are government public-owned by MCOT the 2 television channels 
        terrestrial free-to-air Modernine TV and Channel 3. Channel 5 and BBTV Channel 7 are owned by Royal Thai Army, 
        while NBT and Thai PBS are fully government-owned. Analog terrestrial transmissions were switched off in 
        phases as part of the digital switchover, which was completed in 2020 in line with ASEAN recommendations.</p>
