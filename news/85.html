    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Long before the creation of LNTV, Laotians had access 
        to overspill television signals from neighboring Thailand.</p>
    <p class="lead">Lao National Television was established and began broadcasting television programs on December 1, 1983. 
        At that time, the television station carried out pilot broadcasts twice a week, 
        and later gradually increased the broadcast time.</p>
    <p class="lead">At the beginning of its operations, LNTV broadcast only in Vientiane with Soviet support. 
        Resources to operate the station were poor, coupled by the country's geographic and economical problems, 
        with a small number of viewers having access to the channel and its schedule lasted for an 
        average of two to three hours per evening.</p>
    <p class="lead">Work for new facilities began on January 12, 2001, with assistance from Vietnam Television.</p>
    <p class="lead">On September 2, 2015, Lao National Television signed a new cooperation agreement with Vietnam Television, 
        and Lao National Television started producing and broadcasting Vietnamese-language news programs.</p>
    <p class="lead">In September 2019, with the aid of China, 
        LNTV Channel 3 was upgraded from standard definition to high definition.</p>
