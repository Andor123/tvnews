    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Turkey was introduced in 1964 by the government media provider TRT.
        The first Turkish television channel, ITU TV, was launched in 1952.
        First national television is TRT 1. Color television was introduced in 1981.
        Back then it was the only channel with the name of TRT 1,
        and it broadcast in several times of the dateline.
        Turkey's first private television channel Star
        started it broadcast on 26 May 1989.</p>
    <p class="lead">Until the 1990s, there was only one television channel controlled by the state,
        but with the wave of liberalization, privately owned broadcasting began.
        Turkey's television market is defined by a handful of big channels,
        led by Kanal D, ATV and Show, with 14%, 10% and 9.6% market share, respectively.</p>
    <p class="lead">The most important reception platforms are terrestrial and satellite,
        with almost 50% of homes using satellite (of these 15% were pay services)
        at the end of 2009. Three services dominate the multi-channel market:
        the satellite platforms Digit端rk and D-Smart and the cable TV service T端rksat.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Digital</h2>
    <p class="lead">As of 2013, pay television services in Turkey include
        Digiturk, D-Smart, TeleD端nya, T端rksat KabloTV and Tivibu.</p>
    <p class="lead">The Uzan Group made the first digital television transmissions
        in Turkey with Turkey's first television channel Star TV. As they were
        on the lead with their channels Star, TeleOn and Kral, the Uzan Group launched
        Star Digital on Turksat in late 1999. In 2003, the platform's name was
        changed as DigiFun Club, but it was short lived before became defunct.</p>
    <p class="lead">Turkey's first pay television provider, CINE5 from MultiCanal
        (owned by Erol Aksoy) launched in late 1994. It held the rights to the latest
        movie premieres, series and especially sports such as the Turkish Football League.
        In 2000, CINE5 launched CINE+Digital on Turksat with some specialty channels,
        but again in 2003 this platform was taken down.</p>
