    <h1 class="h1">Television in Iraq</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Iraq was home to the first television station in the Middle East, 
        which began during the 1950s. As part of a plan to help Iraq modernize, 
        British telecommunications company Pye Limited built and commissioned a television broadcast station in the capital city of Baghdad. 
        Following the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, the Iraqi state media collapsed. In June 2004, 
        a Communications and Media Commission was set up to approve and grant license for all the country's media. 
        By 2011, Iraq was the headquarters of 49 free-to-air satellite channels, one of the highest numbers in the region. 
        Until 2003, satellite dishes were banned in Iraq, and there was a limited number of national terrestrial stations. 
        After 2003, the sale of satellite dishes surged, and free-to-air channels entered the market. 
        There are 17 terrestrial channels, of which one is funded by the US government through the U.S. Agency for Global Media (Alhurra-Iraq), 
        and seven are owned by the state broadcaster Iraqi Media Network. 
        In March 2011, Al Jazeera was granted rights to resume operations after being banned in 2004. 
        Plans were established to set up a free-media zone based in Baghdad, the Baghdad Media City, by the end of 2014.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">Television first arrived in Iraq on 2 May 1956, 
        at first only in the Baghdad area with a station named Baghdad Television on channel 8, 
        switching to channel 9 in November 1959 after an increasing of its power. 
        On 18 November 1967 the second TV station opened in Kirkuk, 
        on 2 March 1968 a new transmitter had been opened in Mosul and on 6 November 1968 in Basrah. 
        On 30 July 1972 Baghdad Television opened its second TV station on channel 7, 
        and in 1974 two new stations opened in Amarah (capital city of the Maysan Governorate) 
        and Samawah (capital city of the Muthanna Governorate), the latter one opening in March. 
        In July 1976 colour television was introduced using the French SECAM system. 
        By 1976 the entire country could receive broadcasts from the central station 
        in Baghdad after the installation of a microwave relay system.</p>
    <p class="lead">Many TV stations have appeared since the fall of Saddam. 
        Under the direction of Ambassador L. Paul Bremer III as the Administrator, 
        the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) began issuing radio and television 
        licenses in June 2003 to meet the great demand for broadcasting licenses. 
        The licenses were issued by the CPA Senior Adviser for Telecommunications. 
        To plan for the expected great demand, this CPA office worked with Iraqi radio-frequency 
        spectrum engineers and managers to develop a national FM-radio and TV channel allotment 
        plan for all of the major Iraqi cities and towns. The national plan was developed using 
        technical criteria and the Region 1 (Europe, Africa and the Middle East) allotment plan 
        that was developed years before by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), 
        a United Nations treaty organization. The Iraqi allotment plan consisted of hundreds 
        of FM radio and TV stations allotted to the cities and towns. The channels in the allotment 
        plan were then open to anyone to apply for a license for a particular channel.</p>
