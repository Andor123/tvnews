    <h1 class="h1">Television in Malaysia</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Malaysian television broadcasting was introduced on 28 December 1963. 
        Colour television was introduced on 28 December 1978. Full-time colour transmissions were officially inaugurated on New Year's Day 1982. 
        There are currently 16 national free-to-air terrestrial television channels in Malaysia 
        and 3 national pay subscription television operators in Malaysia.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Broadcasting</h2>
    <p class="lead">Transmissions in Malaysia were black-and-white until 28 December 1978, when colour transmissions were introduced. 
        First stereo audio broadcasting was introduced in 1985 by TV3. Five out of eight channels do not have 24-hour schedule. 
        24-hour television was introduced in Malaysia between 13 and 16 May 1989 on TV1. The first 24-hour broadcasting in Malaysia 
        was introduced in 1997 by TV3, but was discontinued later due to energy-saving plan (see below). Since April 2006, 
        TV2 broadcast round-the-clock followed by TV1, which began broadcasting 24 hours in August 2012 after 
        having short-lived round-the-clock broadcast previously.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Analogue terrestrial television</h2>
    <p class="lead">This was the traditional way of receiving television in Malaysia, however it is being supplanted by digital providers. 
        There are eight channels; three of them are government public-owned by Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM). 
        The three television channels are terrestrial free-to-air TV1, TV2 and Okey (formerly TVi). 
        TV Alhijrah is owned by Alhijrah Media Corporation while TV3, NTV7, 8TV and TV9 are private and 
        commercially owned by Media Prima. Worldview Broadcasting Channel was commercial-owned by Worldview Broadcasting Channel (M) Sdn Bhd. 
        It has since closed down in October 2012 after they were unable to operate the channel due to financial difficulties. 
        Analogue terrestrial transmissions were scheduled to be switched off in phases as part of the digital switchover, 
        expected to be completed in 2020 as a recommendation from Southeast Asia. On 31 December 2018, digital television 
        consortium MYTV Broadcasting scheduled the switchoff on third quarter 2019, to allow a period of digital 
        set-top box distribution to eligible viewers with low income. The frequency has been moved to avoid signal 
        jamming with television in Thailand and preventing Singaporeans from watching foreign-copyrighted programming, 
        especially that contains Chinese dialects (mainly in Cantonese and Hokkien) on free-to-air, 
        due to tight censorship currently in place in Singapore. The analogue were indefinitely switched off nationwide on 31 October 2019.</p>
