    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in North Macedonia was first introduced in 1964;
        it remains the most popular news medium. The public broadcaster is
        the Macedonian Radio-Television, founded in 1993. TEKO TV (1989)
        from Å tip is the first private television channel in the country.
        Other popular private channels are: Sitel, Kanal 5, Telma, Alfa TV,
        and Alsat-M.Most private media are tied to political or business
        interests and state media tend to support the government.
        Public broadcast networks face stiff competition from commercial
        stations, which dominate the ratings. A European Union sponsored report
        says that with scores of TV and radio networks, the market is overcrowded
        and many local broadcasters are struggling to survive financially.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">DVB-T</h2>
    <p class="lead">DVB-T was introduced in Republic of Macedonia in November,
        2009 as a Pay TV platform known as BoomTV by ONE. The platform includes
        the Republic of Macedonia channels with national frequency and the
        most popular world channels. Boom TV is using 3 multiplexes
        (MUX 1, MUX 2 and MUX 3). The DVB-T switch off in Macedonia has
        completed on 1 June 2013. MRD (Republic of Macedonia Broadcasting Council)
        operates and maintains the DVB-T network in the Republic of Macedonia and
        the public Macedonian Radio-Television using MUX 4 and MUX 5 while ONE
        operates the private national and local TV stations in Macedonia
        using MUX 6 and MUX 7.</p>
    <p class="lead">The DVB-T transmissions in Macedonia are standard-definition
        and high-definition, MPEG-4, X7F modulation, 64-QAM, 2/3 Code-rate.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">IPTV</h2>
    <p class="lead">On 17 November 2008, IPTV officially started in Macedonia when
        the country's first IPTV service, MaxTV, was launched by Makedonski Telekom.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Cable Television</h2>
    <p class="lead">Cable television is highly developed, with cable television
        penetration in Skopje at 67% of all households. There are 49 cable
        TV providers with the two majors Blizoo and Telekabel holding 80%
