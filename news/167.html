    <h1 class="h1">Television in the United States of America</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television is one of the major mass media outlets in the United States. 
        In 2011, 96.7% of households owned television sets; about 114,200,000 American households owned at least one television set each in August 2013. 
        Most households have more than one set. The percentage of households owning at least one television set peaked at 98.4%, in the 1996–1997 season. 
        In 1948, 1 percent of U.S. households owned at least one television; in 1955, 75 percent did. 
        In 1992, 60 percent of all U.S. households had cable television subscriptions. However, this number has fallen to 40% in 2024.</p>
    <p class="lead">As a whole, the television networks that broadcast in the United States are the largest and most distributed in the world, 
        and programs produced specifically for American networks are the most widely syndicated internationally. 
        Because of a surge in the number and popularity of critically acclaimed television series in the 2000s and the 2010s, 
        many critics have said that American television has entered a modern golden age; 
        whether that golden age has ended or is ongoing in the early 2020s is disputed.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Television channels and networks</h2>
    <p class="lead">In the United States, television is available via broadcast (also known as "over-the-air" or OTA) – the earliest method of 
        receiving television programming, which merely requires an antenna and an equipped internal or external tuner capable of picking up 
        channels that transmit on the two principal broadcast bands, very high frequency (VHF) and ultra high frequency (UHF), 
        to receive the signal – and four conventional types of multichannel subscription television: cable, unencrypted satellite ("free-to-air"), 
        direct-broadcast satellite television and Internet Protocol Television (IPTV). There are also competing video services on the World Wide Web, 
        which have become an increasingly popular mode of television viewing since the late 2000s, particularly with younger audiences as an alternative 
        or a supplement to the aforementioned traditional forms of viewing television content; the 2010s saw the development of several virtual 
        Multichannel Video Programming Distributor (MVPD) services offering "skinny" tiers of channels originally developed for cable and satellite distribution 
        at a reduced base price compared to providers using the more established pay television distribution methods.</p>
    <p class="lead">Individual broadcast television stations in the U.S. transmit on either VHF channels 2 through 13 or UHF channels 14 through 36. 
        During the era of analog television, broadcast stations transmitted on a single universal channel; however due to the technical complexities 
        of the present digital television standard, most stations now transmit physically on an RF channel that is mapped to a virtual channel, 
        which – with some exceptions – typically differs from their physical allocation and corresponds to the station's former analog channel. 
        The UHF band originally spanned from channels 14 to 83, though the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has reduced the bandwidth allocation 
        for UHF three times since then. Channels 70 to 83 were cut for emergency and other telecommunications purposes in 1983. 
        In 2009, channels 52 to 69 were removed by mandate at the completion of the transition from analog to digital television. 
        In 2020, transition away from channels above 36 was completed to make room for its use by telecommunications companies, after a 2017 spectrum auction.</p>
