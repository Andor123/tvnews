    <h1 class="h1">Television in Bulgaria</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Bulgaria was introduced in 1959.
        Although the Bulgarian media market is small,
        it is one of the most vibrant and highly competitive in Central
        and Eastern Europe. Global players such as News Corporation,
        Modern Times Group, Central European Media Enterprises HD
        Sofia TV and Fox Broadcasting Company and others operate
        the biggest and most popular media outlets in the country.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Cable</h2>
    <p class="lead">Cable television (CATV) in Bulgaria appeared in the early 1990s,
        with some of the earliest networks starting operation in 1991 and 1992.
        Satellite channels from other countries were one of the main features of
        cable television at the time and in the following years channels like
        Cartoon Network Europe, MTV European and Discovery Channel became very
        popular, as more people subscribed to the (relatively cheap) cable TV operators.
        Many (if not all) cable companies created their own television channels,
        which were available only to their subscribers. Due to technical limitations,
        it was initially difficult for such channels to be distributed to other
        populated places in the country, but in the late 90s several channels
        started to appear in the entire country using Bulgarian Telecommunications
        Company cables as the distribution method. In 1998, M SAT
        (then known as Mustang Sat) became the first Bulgarian channel
        available via satellite. The local terrestrial channel Nova Television
        from Sofia became available all over the country in 1999 using cable
        transmission. Around 2000-2001, some foreign broadcasters such as Discovery
        Channel and the Hallmark Channel (now DIVA Universal started Bulgarian
        translations of their channels using DVB subtitles. Currently,
        most cable networks carry a large selection of local and foreign channels,
        both translated and untranslated. Translation of foreign networks has since
        expanded from subtitles to voice dubbing, with channels like AXN and Jetix
        (formerly Fox Kids) (now Disney Channel) having a Bulgarian audio track.</p>
    <p class="lead">Analogue broadcasting is still used by operators,
        and it was the only method used before 2004-2005. Since then,
        many of them started lowering the number of analogue channels
        in order to launch DVB-C transponders. However, because the monthly
        fee for the digital packages is higher, some subscribers choose to
        continue using the analogue service, although with less channels than before.
        Currently, the biggest cable operators provide DVB-C channels in the major
        cities and towns. As of 2009, analogue channels are usually the
        only service available in villages.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Satellite</h2>
    <p class="lead">Satellite channels from Bulgaria appeared prior to the existence
        of a DTH operator. The first channel to start broadcasting via satellite was
        MSAT (then known as Mustang Sat, after parent company Mustang) in 1998,
        operating from Varna. Before this, the Mustang channel was distributed through
        cable lines, maintained by the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company.
        The following year, the Bulgarian National Television launched a special channel,
        TV Bulgaria (now known as BNT World), dedicated to Bulgarians living abroad.
        Several other channels followed, including the musical channel MM.</p>
    <p class="lead">Then, in 2003, Bulsatcom became the first Bulgarian DTH operator,
        offering initially a limited amount of channels on Hellas Sat 2.
        The next year, ITV Partner (now Satellite BG) was launched as a
        DTH service by Interactive Technologies PLC, broadcasting on Eutelsat W2.
        Both supply DVB-S satellite television in Bulgaria and most European countries,
        with some of the TV channels using the two DTH operators as their main distribution
        medium (so that the channels are easily available to cable operators without the use
        of long-distance wires). The second half of 2010 saw the long anticipated launch
        of the third Bulgarian DTH provider, operated by Bulgaria's Vivacom.
        There is also a small package operated by Telenor on Thor 3, which has for a
        long time distributed certain Bulgarian TV and radio channels.</p>
    <p class="lead">Generally, Bulgarian television companies do not require a high fee for
        their channels' availability to viewers (some have no fee at all), but because
        of licensing restrictions of foreign programming, most satellite channels are encrypted,
        so that distribution outside Bulgaria can be limited. Free-to-view channels carry less
        (or none at all) such programming, airing for example music or locally produced
        programs only. Currently, most channels that broadcast nationally are available via satellite.</p>
