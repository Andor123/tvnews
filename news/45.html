    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Malta was first introduced in 1957. 
        The first person to sell televisions in Malta was The Most Noble Count Consiglio D'Amato.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">The first television that could be watched were RAI broadcasts from Sicily. 
        In 1962, TVM was launched as a Maltese public broadcaster by the Public Broadcasting Services. 
        TVM remains the most popular channel in the country and is a member of the European Broadcasting Union.</p>
    <p class="lead">In 1991 the government opened the television market to more stations, 
        but rather than allow private companies, they initially gave licenses 
        to the two main political parties and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Malta. 
        The Labour Party's television network One remains the second most popular network, 
        while the Nationalist-controlled NET Television is the third most popular.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Digital</h2>
    <p class="lead">Two commercial terrestrial television licences were awarded in 
        2005 to Multiplus Ltd and Maltacom (now GO). In July 2005, Multiplus Ltd started 
        commercial operations in direct competition to the existing dominant cable operator 
        Melita utilising a total of 8 frequencies. Multiplus was acquired by GO in February 2007.</p>
