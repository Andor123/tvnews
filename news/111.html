    <h1 class="h1">Television in Egypt</h1>
    <p class="lead">Source: <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
    <p class="lead">Television in Egypt is mainly received through free satellite, 
        while analog terrestrial represents 41% of total viewers. The Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics 
        said the average time an Egyptian spends watching television a day is 180 minutes (3 hours), 
        while Egyptian channels recorded 170,000 hours of broadcast in 2019.</p>
    <p class="lead">Since Egypt launched its first broadcasts in 1960, state-run channels have held a monopoly on terrestrial broadcast. 
        The Ministry of Information strictly regulated private satellite channels as well. The Egyptian Radio and Television Union, 
        a government entity, owns all 17 terrestrial channels. Channel 1 and Channel 2 are the network’s main channels and broadcast across Egypt. 
        The state-owned Nile TV is the main foreign language channel, aims at promoting Egypt's state point of view and promote tourism. 
        There are 6 regional terrestrial channels, which used to all be broadcast to Greater Cairo, but as of 2007, 
        only Greater Cairo channel (Channel 3) of the regional channels is broadcast to Greater Cairo. 
        Most terrestrial channels were in fact satellite channels owned by ERTU, but simulcasted to Greater Cairo, since 2007.</p>
    <p class="lead">In the 1990s, there used to be an Egyptian company called CNE (Cable Network of Egypt) which provided 
        a few foreign pay TV stations broadcast terrestrially over the air (CNN International, MTV Europe with one show made for Arab League viewers, 
        and other defunct channels), but needed a special receiver and a card.</p>
    <p class="lead">The overwhelming number of private satellite stations launched during 2008 until 2012 has changed the 
        Egyptian TV production market drastically, lifting the dominant hand of state-run channels off the market. Over 50 TV series 
        have been broadcast annually during Ramadan – Main TV viewership season. 
        Introduction of dubbed TV shows – from Turkey and India mainly- on Egyptian TV channels made the market more competitive. 
        Egyptian TV productions companies started to adapt in efforts to match the foreign offerings which started to dominate the market. 
        Companies like Egyptian Arts Group, El Adl Group and many others started doubling their annual production budgets in efforts 
        to match the foreign TV series offerings in terms of quality of production.</p>
